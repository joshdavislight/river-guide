# Middle Fork Salmon River

The Middle Fork of the Salmon River is the quintessential wilderness river trip in North America. Flowing 104 miles through the heart of the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness, it offers an unparalleled combination of whitewater, hot springs, fishing, side hikes, and pristine wilderness.

## Overview

The river drops over 3,000 feet from Boundary Creek to its confluence with the Main Salmon at Cache Bar. The gradient creates continuous Class III-IV whitewater with several standout rapids that deserve respect and scouting.

## The Experience

What sets the Middle Fork apart is the complete package: crystal-clear water, abundant wildlife, natural hot springs at nearly every camp, world-class fly fishing for cutthroat and rainbow trout, and a true wilderness setting where you won't see roads, powerlines, or other signs of civilization for the entire trip.

## When to Go

**High water (June):** Big, pushy water. Tappan Falls and Redside become serious. Experienced boaters only.

**Mid-season (July):** Sweet spot for most groups. Warm weather, good flows, manageable rapids.

**Late season (August-September):** Lower, more technical water. Warmer swimming. Fishing peaks.

## Permit Strategy

With only 361 permits for over 20,000 applicants, the Middle Fork lottery is brutally competitive. Tips:
- Apply for shoulder season dates (late May, early September)
- Check for cancellations starting mid-March
- Pre/post season permits (before May 28, after September 3) are first-come-first-served starting October 1

## Special Considerations

- Camps are assigned during control season
- Fires may be restricted - bring a stove
- Bear canisters recommended (not required)
- Fly-in option to Indian Creek adds cost but epic experience
