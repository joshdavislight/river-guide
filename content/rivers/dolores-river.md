# Dolores River

The Dolores is the "Feast or Famine" river of the West. When McPhee Dam releases water, it's one of the finest desert canyon trips anywhere. When it doesn't, there's no river trip at all.

## Overview

From Bradfield Bridge in Colorado to Bedrock, Slickrock, or Dewey Bridge in Utah, the Dolores offers up to 150 miles of desert canyon with Class II-IV whitewater. Snaggletooth is the marquee Class IV.

## The Experience

When the Dolores runs, it's magic. The canyon walls glow in shades of red and orange, the whitewater is excellent, and the isolation is real. But the river is entirely dependent on McPhee Dam releases — and those releases are not guaranteed.

## When to Go

**April-June:** The only window. Check dam release schedules.

**Memorial Day:** Often peak releases if they happen.

## Permit Strategy

Utah section (Gateway to Dewey) requires BLM permit — call (435) 259-7012. Colorado sections vary.

## Special Considerations

- ⚠️ EXTREMELY flow dependent — check McPhee Dam release schedule
- May not run most years
- When it runs, usually peaks around Memorial Day
- Multiple section options — Bradfield to Bedrock, Gateway to Dewey
- The reward for persistence is one of the best desert river trips
