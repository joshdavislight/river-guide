Cataract Canyon is the wild heart of Canyonlands National Park, where the Green and Colorado Rivers merge and drop through some of the biggest whitewater in the West. The Big Drops—a series of three Class IV-V rapids in quick succession—are legendary among river runners and have become increasingly dramatic as Lake Powell recedes, exposing formerly submerged rapids. Starting from Potash (Colorado River side) or Mineral Bottom (Green River side), the trip flows 60+ miles through stunning red rock canyon country before reaching Cataract's signature whitewater.

The first 50+ miles are relatively mellow flatwater floating through some of the most spectacular canyon scenery in North America—towering Wingate cliffs, ancient Native American sites, and the dramatic Confluence where the Green and Colorado merge. Then, starting at mile 52, the gradient increases sharply and Cataract Canyon begins. The Big Drops are serious business at high water (30,000+ cfs)—massive standing waves, powerful hydraulics, and real consequences for mistakes. At lower water (10,000-20,000 cfs), they're more technical but more manageable. The challenge: Lake Powell's fluctuating backwater creates significant flatwater rowing at trip's end, sometimes requiring motorized assistance or jet boat pickup.

## When to Go

**May-June:** High water season (25,000-60,000+ cfs). Big Drops at their most powerful and spectacular—true Class V big water with 15-20 foot standing waves. For expert boaters only. Cold water (50-60°F).

**July-August:** Moderate flows (10,000-25,000 cfs). Big Drops are still impressive but more manageable—solid Class IV territory. Warm water (65-75°F). This is the sweet spot for most groups.

**September-October:** Lower water (5,000-15,000 cfs). Big Drops become more technical rock gardens. Cooler temps (70-90°F), fewer people. As Lake Powell drops, more rapids emerge downstream.

### When NOT to Go

**When Lake Powell backwater extends past Dirty Devil:** Check current Lake Powell reservoir levels before committing. When the reservoir is high, it can back up 10-15 miles past the normal takeout at Hite/Dirty Devil, creating a brutal flatwater row against headwinds. This can add 3-6+ hours of miserable rowing or require expensive motor/jet boat assist. If backwater extends significantly, seriously consider postponing.

**Peak runoff (above 50,000 cfs):** At extreme high water, the Big Drops become genuine Class V with enormous hydraulics that can flip and hold large rafts. Unless your group has extensive big-water experience, these flows are too powerful. Multiple commercial trips have had serious incidents at 60,000+ cfs.

**Extreme low water (below 8,000 cfs):** The Big Drops lose their punch and become technical rock gardens. Not worth the logistics hassle for diminished whitewater.

## Permit Strategy

[Cataract Canyon uses first-come-first-served permits](https://www.recreation.gov/permits/621747). Permits for the entire year become available on Jan. 1 via Recreation.gov. Approximately 95% success rate if you book when reservations open. Tips:
- Book early for your desired dates
- Spring (May-June) fills fastest for optimal flows
- Fall dates (September-October) often available last-minute
- No lottery, no waiting—just plan ahead

**Permit Realities:**
- **Self-issue system is straightforward** - Unlike lottery rivers, you just book a date. If it's available, you're in. Simple.
- **Jet boat coordination is CRITICAL** - You must arrange jet boat pickup from Hite/Dirty Devil well in advance. This isn't optional—there's no road access to most takeout points. Jet boat services book up months ahead. Budget $150-250/person.
- **Lake Powell levels change everything** - The reservoir level determines how much flatwater rowing you'll face. Check Bureau of Reclamation data for current pool elevation. Below 3,550 feet elevation, more rapids are exposed and backwater is minimal. Above 3,600 feet, expect significant flatwater.
- **Motor permits available** - If Lake Powell backwater is extensive, consider getting a motor permit to power through the flatwater. Adds weight/complexity but saves hours of rowing into headwinds.

## Special Considerations

- 🌊 **Big Drop 2 is the crux** - Mile 62.5. At high water (30,000+ cfs), this rapid features enormous holes capable of flipping 18-foot rafts. The "Big Drop 2 Hole" is river-wide and unavoidable. Scout carefully from Spanish Bottom camp the evening before. Run far right or far left depending on flow. Center is certain carnage at high water.
- 🌊 **Big Drop 3 (Satan's Gut) at extreme high water** - Above 50,000 cfs, Satan's Gut becomes one of the most intimidating rapids in North America—a churning maelstrom of 20+ foot waves. Commercial trips have been known to portage at these flows. Not for the faint of heart.
- 🚤 **Lake Powell backwater requires motor/jet boat** - The reservoir's fluctuating level creates anywhere from 5-25 miles of flatwater at trip's end. Rowing against afternoon headwinds is brutal and can take 6+ hours. Most groups either: (1) bring a small outboard motor, (2) arrange jet boat pickup partway through the flatwater, or (3) suffer. Plan accordingly and budget for jet boat costs ($150-250/person).
- 🏜️ **Exposed camps due to dropping Lake Powell** - As the reservoir shrinks, formerly submerged camps are re-emerging but may lack established facilities. New rapids are also appearing. Check recent trip reports for current conditions—this river is changing year to year.
- 🏕️ **Spanish Bottom is mandatory scout camp** - Mile 59. Camp here the night before running the Big Drops. Scout all three rapids from the right bank in the evening. Discuss lines with your group. This is not optional—running the Big Drops blind is foolish.
- ⛺ **Limited camps in the flatwater section** - The first 50 miles have excellent camps, but quality drops significantly once you enter the flatwater/Lake Powell section. Plan your mileage to camp before the flatwater begins.
- 🌡️ **Extreme heat possible** - July-August temps can exceed 110°F in the deep canyon. Minimal shade at camps. Bring shade structures and plenty of water.
- 🚗 **Takeout logistics are complex** - There's no simple drive-up takeout. You need either: jet boat pickup, helicopter extraction (extremely expensive), or hiking out miles through desert. Coordinate transportation well in advance with reputable companies.
- 📡 **No cell service anywhere** - Complete communication blackout. Bring satellite communicator for emergencies.
- 🎣 **Fishing is poor** - Muddy water, limited fish population. Don't come for the fishing.
