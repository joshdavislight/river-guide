# Colorado River – Ruby/Horsethief Canyons

Ruby and Horsethief Canyons offer an excellent introduction to multi-day river camping with minimal whitewater challenge. This is 25 miles of scenic floating through colorful Colorado Plateau canyon with good side hikes, easy logistics, and family-friendly Class I-II water that barely qualifies as whitewater.

If you're looking to introduce family or friends to river camping without the stress of rapids or competitive permits, Ruby/Horsethief delivers a relaxed desert experience.

## When to Go

### April-May (6,000-15,000 cfs)
Spring runoff brings higher flows that move you downstream efficiently. Cooler temps are pleasant for hiking side canyons. Wildflowers bloom in the desert. This is the busiest season as groups combine Ruby/Horsethief with Westwater for 4-day trips.

### September-October (4,000-8,000 cfs)
Fall offers beautiful weather, lower flows, and fewer crowds. Days are warm, nights are cool, and the desert is less brutal than summer. This is arguably the best season for a relaxed trip.

### June-August (Year-round flows)
Summer is hot—expect 90-100°F+ temperatures. The river is runnable, but the heat can be oppressive, especially in the exposed canyon with limited shade. Bring lots of water and sun protection.

### When NOT to Go

**Afternoon headwinds (any season):** The Colorado Plateau is notorious for brutal afternoon headwinds that can turn easy floating into exhausting upwind rowing. Winds typically pick up around 1-3 PM and can blow 20-30 mph upstream. Groups have been stuck for hours making almost no progress. Launch early (7-8 AM) and plan to be off the water or in camp by 2-3 PM.

**High water above 20,000 cfs:** While Ruby/Horsethief has no dangerous rapids, very high water moves fast and can make controlling boats difficult for beginners. The current becomes pushy, and eddying out to explore side canyons or scout camps becomes challenging.

## Permit Strategy

Reservations open 60 days in advance through [Recreation.gov](https://www.recreation.gov/permits/74466). Success rate is around 90% with any flexibility on dates. Camps are assigned when you make your reservation, eliminating the race for good sites.

**Permit Realities:**

Permits are straightforward and reliable. You pick your launch date, see available camps, and reserve them 60 days out. The BLM assigns camps based on group size and availability—no stress, no competition on the river. This makes Ruby/Horsethief ideal for groups that want guaranteed camps rather than the free-for-all of first-come systems.

## Special Considerations

- 💨 **Afternoon headwinds are REAL and exhausting** - This is the #1 complaint on trip reports. Beautiful calm morning turns into brutal upwind slog by 2 PM. The Colorado Plateau funnels wind through the canyon, and you'll be rowing directly into it. Launch early (before 8 AM), cover miles in the morning, and be in camp by 2 PM. Groups that ignore this warning spend hours going nowhere and arrive at camps exhausted and frustrated.
- 🏕️ **Often combined with Westwater Canyon** - Many groups run Ruby/Horsethief (days 1-2) then continue into Westwater Canyon (days 3-4) for a complete 4-day Colorado River experience. This gives you mellow floating for the first half and legitimate Class III-IV whitewater for the second half. Book both permits together.
- 🪨 **Black Rocks showcases ancient Precambrian rock** - At mile 15, the canyon walls expose 1.7-billion-year-old Precambrian rock—some of the oldest exposed rock on Earth. This is the same ancient rock you'll see in Westwater's inner gorge. Take time to explore and appreciate the geology.
- 🥾 **Side canyon hikes are the highlights** - Knowles Canyon, Mee Canyon, and Rattlesnake Canyon offer excellent hiking with slot canyons, arches, and petroglyphs. These side trips are what make Ruby/Horsethief special—it's not about the whitewater. Budget time to explore rather than just cranking miles.
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Excellent beginner/family multi-day introduction** - Class II maximum, easy camping, straightforward logistics, and assigned camps make this perfect for groups new to multi-day river trips. Kids as young as 5-6 commonly run this section with families.
- 🚗 **Shuttle services are abundant and affordable** - Multiple shuttle services operate between Loma and Westwater/Cisco. Expect $50-80 per vehicle. Services are professional and reliable. Book ahead during peak season (April-May).
- 🌵 **Rattlesnakes in warmer months** - Desert canyon = rattlesnakes, especially April-October. They're generally not aggressive, but watch where you put hands and feet when hiking or setting up camp. Most encounters are harmless if you give them space.
