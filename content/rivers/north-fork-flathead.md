# North Fork Flathead River

The North Fork Flathead flows along the western boundary of Glacier National Park, offering crystal-clear glacial water and stunning mountain scenery with no permit required and no whitewater challenge.

## Overview

From the Canadian border area to Columbia Falls, the North Fork offers 59 miles of mellow floating through some of Montana's most beautiful scenery. The water is extraordinarily clear, the mountains are dramatic, and grizzly bears are real.

## The Experience

This is a scenic float, not a whitewater trip. The North Fork is about the setting — Glacier National Park rising to the east, pristine wilderness surrounding you, and water so clear it seems bottomless.

## When to Go

**June-August:** Best weather. Good flows.

**September:** Cooling temps. Lower water.

## Permit Strategy

No permit required. Camp on National Forest land.

## Special Considerations

- No whitewater challenge — Class II maximum
- Adjacent to Glacier National Park
- Grizzly bear country — take bear safety seriously
- Crystal clear glacial water
- Cold water year-round
