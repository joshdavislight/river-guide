# Green River — Gates of Lodore

The Gates of Lodore was named by John Wesley Powell on his 1869 expedition through the canyons of the Green and Colorado Rivers. Today, this 43-mile section through Dinosaur National Monument offers solid Class III-IV whitewater with a longer season than the Yampa thanks to Flaming Gorge Dam releases.

## Overview

Starting at the dramatic Gates of Lodore — a sandstone portal into the canyon — the river flows through Lodore Canyon to Echo Park, where it meets the Yampa River. From Echo Park, it's another 19 miles to the Split Mountain takeout.

## The Experience

Lodore has a different feel than the Yampa — dam-controlled flows mean cold, clear water and a predictable season. The canyon is dramatic red sandstone, and the rapids are solid. Hell's Half Mile is the marquee Class IV, a long boulder garden that demands respect.

The Jones Hole hike to petroglyphs is a highlight, and Echo Park's confluence with the Yampa offers a sense of the canyon system's scale.

## When to Go

**May-June:** Higher flows from dam releases. Bigger rapids.

**July-August:** More moderate flows. Warmer weather.

**September:** Lower flows. End of permit season.

## Permit Strategy

At ~10% odds, Gates of Lodore is more attainable than the Yampa:

- Apply in December-January via Recreation.gov
- Good backup if you don't win Yampa lottery
- If you win both, combine for an epic trip

## Special Considerations

- Named by John Wesley Powell — historic significance
- Dam-controlled = longer, more reliable season than Yampa
- Cold water year-round from Flaming Gorge releases — drysuits help early season
- Can combine with Yampa if you win both permits
- Jones Hole side hike is excellent
