# Gunnison Gorge / Black Canyon

The Gunnison Gorge sits below Black Canyon National Park, offering an intimate 14-mile journey through steep canyon walls with Gold Medal trout fishing. The hike-in access adds to the adventure.

## Overview

From the Chukar Trail put-in (1-mile hike) to Gunnison Forks, the Gunnison flows through a dramatic narrow canyon. The whitewater is friendly Class II-III, making it accessible for intermediate paddlers.

## The Experience

The Gunnison Gorge feels remote despite its relative accessibility. The canyon walls tower overhead, the fishing is world-class (Gold Medal designation), and the dam-controlled flows mean reliable water all season.

## When to Go

**May-September:** Best weather. Reliable dam-controlled flows.

## Permit Strategy

Free permit via Recreation.gov. ~90% success rate with flexibility.

## Special Considerations

- Hike-in access via Chukar Trail (1 mile, steep) — pack accordingly
- Below Black Canyon National Park
- Gold Medal trout waters — outstanding fly fishing
- Cold water year-round from dam
- Intimate canyon experience
