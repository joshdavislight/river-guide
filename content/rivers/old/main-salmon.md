# Main Salmon River

The Main Salmon—"River of No Return"—is Idaho's other world-class wilderness river trip. While it shares the lottery with the Middle Fork, the Main offers bigger water, huge beaches, and a more relaxed pace perfect for families and groups looking for a grand adventure without extreme whitewater.

## Overview

The Main Salmon carves 79 miles through the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness, the largest contiguous wilderness in the Lower 48. The river is big volume—up to 50,000 cfs at peak—but the rapids are more forgiving than the Middle Fork's pool-drop character.

## The Experience

The Main Salmon is the "big beach" trip. Massive sand bars, excellent swimming, historic homesteads, and Barth Hot Springs make this a river that appeals to all ages and skill levels. The fishing is exceptional, with steelhead runs in fall and resident trout year-round.

## When to Go

**High water (June):** Big, pushy, and exciting. For experienced boaters.

**Prime season (July-August):** Warm, swimable, perfect flows for all skill levels.

**Fall (September):** Lower water, steelhead runs, fewer people, golden light.

## Permit Strategy

Shared lottery with the Middle Fork, but slightly better odds. Tips:
- Apply for both rivers to increase chances
- Early and late season dates have better odds
- The Main is equally spectacular—don't consider it a "consolation prize"
