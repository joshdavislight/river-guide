# Arkansas River — Browns Canyon

Browns Canyon is the most commercially rafted stretch of river in the United States, but it's also excellent for private boaters. With no permit required and easy access, it's a reliable option when lottery rivers don't pan out.

## Overview

From Fisherman's Bridge to Hecla Junction (or Stone Bridge), the Arkansas flows 20 miles through Browns Canyon National Monument. The whitewater is consistent Class III-IV with multiple quality rapids.

## The Experience

Browns Canyon delivers reliable Class III-IV whitewater with minimal logistics. The rapids are fun without being committing, the scenery is good, and the infrastructure (shuttle services, gear shops) is excellent.

The downside? Commercial traffic. At peak times, you'll share the river with many guided rafts.

## When to Go

**May-August:** Peak season. Higher flows in June.

**April/September:** Shoulder season. Fewer crowds.

## Permit Strategy

No permit required. 100% success rate.

## Special Considerations

- Most commercially rafted river in US — expect company
- Day trip possible, but overnight camps available
- Browns Canyon National Monument
- Heavy shuttle and outfitter infrastructure in Buena Vista/Salida
- Good backup when lottery rivers fail
