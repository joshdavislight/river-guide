# Green River — Desolation/Gray Canyons

Desolation Canyon is one of the great family-friendly multi-day trips in the West. 84 miles through the largest Wilderness Study Area in the lower 48, with big sandy beaches, manageable Class II-III rapids, and the historic path of John Wesley Powell's 1869 expedition.

## Overview

The Green River enters Desolation Canyon at Sand Wash and flows through increasingly deep canyon before transitioning to Gray Canyon and the Swaseys Beach takeout. The rapids are friendly — mostly Class II with a few III spots — making this an excellent choice for newer boaters or family groups.

## The Experience

Desolation feels remote and wild. The camps are enormous sandy beaches, the canyon walls rise thousands of feet, and the 5-7 day journey gives you time to decompress from modern life. John Wesley Powell named the canyon for its "desolate" appearance, but today's boaters find it anything but.

## When to Go

**May-June:** Higher flows. Faster current means shorter rowing days.

**July-August:** Lower, warmer water. More beach time. Hot.

**September:** End of season. Cooling temps.

## Permit Strategy

At ~3% odds with 11,000 applicants:

- Apply in December-January via Recreation.gov
- Pre/post season permits available starting December 1
- Cancellation permits released on a rolling basis

## Special Considerations

- Excellent family trip — Class II-III is manageable for most groups
- Bring drinking water — silty river water requires good filtration
- Ute Tribal land on east bank — stay on west side
- Historic sites throughout — Rock House, Florence Creek cabin
- Largest Wilderness Study Area in lower 48
