# Grand Canyon

The Grand Canyon of the Colorado River is the ultimate bucket-list river trip. A journey through two billion years of geologic history, world-class whitewater, stunning side canyon hikes, and the most iconic landscape in North America.

## Overview

From Lees Ferry to Diamond Creek, the Colorado River drops through 226 miles of the most spectacular gorge on Earth. The walls rise over a mile above the river, revealing layer upon layer of ancient rock formations.

## The Experience

This is more than a river trip—it's a pilgrimage. The Grand Canyon demands time: most private trips take 16-21 days to truly experience the side hikes, camps, and wonder of the place. Commercial trips are shorter (6-8 days for motorized, 12-14 for oar) but still life-changing.

## When to Go

**Spring (April-May):** Cool nights, warm days, lower crowds. Water is cold.

**Summer (June-August):** Hot. Very hot. But the swimming is incredible and the monsoon storms create spectacular light.

**Fall (September-October):** Sweet spot. Warm water, fewer crowds, mild temperatures.

**Winter:** Only for the hardcore. Cold water, short days, but incredible solitude.

## Permit Strategy

The Grand Canyon lottery is weighted—the more years you apply without winning, the higher your chances. Tips:
- Apply every year starting now
- Choose flexible launch date ranges
- Consider late season dates (October-December) for better odds
- Commercial trips are an option while you build lottery points
