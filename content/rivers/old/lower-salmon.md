# Lower Salmon River

The Lower Salmon picks up where the Main Salmon ends, continuing 54 miles to Heller Bar on the Snake River. With free permits and no lottery, it's the accessible continuation of an Idaho wilderness epic — or a standalone trip in its own right.

## Overview

From Vinegar Creek (or Hammer Creek or Allison Creek) to Heller Bar, the Lower Salmon flows through deep canyon with solid Class III-IV whitewater. Slide Rapid is the critical concern — it's unrunnable above 18,000 cfs.

## The Experience

The Lower Salmon offers the big water experience without the lottery stress. Combined with the Main Salmon, it creates a 7+ day wilderness journey. Standalone, it's a solid 3-4 day trip with good whitewater and beautiful canyon scenery.

## When to Go

**May-June:** Higher flows. Check Slide Rapid conditions.

**July-September:** More moderate flows. Slide Rapid runnable.

## Permit Strategy

Free permit required — available at BLM Cottonwood office or various local businesses. 100% success rate.

## Special Considerations

- ⚠️ Slide Rapid: Scout required. Unrunnable above 18,000 cfs — wait for flows to drop.
- Often combined with Main Salmon for epic 7+ day trip
- Multiple put-in options (Vinegar Creek, Hammer Creek, Allison Creek)
- Free permit — no lottery, no fees
- Ends at Heller Bar where Grande Ronde and Hells Canyon also finish
