# Colorado River — Ruby/Horsethief Canyons

Ruby and Horsethief Canyons offer an excellent introduction to multi-day river camping with minimal whitewater challenge. 25 miles of scenic floating through red rock canyon with good camps and easy logistics.

## Overview

Flowing from the Loma launch in Colorado to Westwater Ranger Station in Utah, Ruby/Horsethief passes through colorful sandstone canyon with good side hikes and family-friendly whitewater. Black Rocks is the only notable rapid — a fun Class II through ancient Precambrian rock.

## The Experience

This is a relaxation trip. The current does most of the work, the camps are scenic, and the side canyons (Knowles, Mee, Rattlesnake) offer good hiking. It's an excellent choice for introducing families or friends to river camping without whitewater stress.

## When to Go

**Year-round:** Runnable anytime with adequate flows.

**Spring/Fall:** Best weather. Avoid summer heat.

## Permit Strategy

Reservations via Recreation.gov, 60 days in advance. ~90% success rate with flexibility.

## Special Considerations

- Often combined with Westwater Canyon for a 4-day trip
- Great family/beginner multi-day introduction
- Black Rocks is ancient Precambrian rock — same as Westwater's inner canyon
- Side canyon hikes are highlights
