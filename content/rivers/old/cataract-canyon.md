# Colorado River — Cataract Canyon

Cataract Canyon is the wild heart of Canyonlands National Park, where the Green and Colorado Rivers merge and drop through some of the biggest whitewater in the West. The Big Drops are legendary — and increasingly runnable as Lake Powell recedes.

## Overview

Starting from Potash (Colorado River side) or Mineral Bottom (Green River side), the trip flows 60+ miles through stunning canyon country before reaching Cataract Canyon's signature whitewater. The Big Drops — three Class IV-V rapids in quick succession — are the marquee attraction.

## The Experience

The first half of the trip is flatwater floating through some of the most spectacular canyon scenery in North America. Then comes the Confluence, where the Green and Colorado merge, and shortly after, Cataract Canyon begins.

The Big Drops are serious business at high water — massive holes, powerful hydraulics, and consequences for mistakes. At lower water, they're more technical but more manageable.

## When to Go

**May-June:** High water. Big Drops at their most powerful. Expert territory.

**July-August:** Moderate flows. More manageable Big Drops.

**Fall:** Lower water. More technical but less intimidating.

## Permit Strategy

Cataract Canyon uses first-come-first-served permits available 4 months in advance via Recreation.gov. ~95% success rate if you plan ahead.

## Special Considerations

- Lake Powell flatwater at end requires motorized boat or jet boat pickup
- As Lake Powell drops, rapids are re-emerging — check current conditions
- Big Drops require scouting — camp at Spanish Bottom the night before
- Combined Green/Colorado trip from Mineral Bottom adds scenic miles
- Coordinate jet boat pickup well in advance
