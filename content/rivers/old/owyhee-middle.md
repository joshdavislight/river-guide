# Owyhee River — Middle Section

The Middle Owyhee is one of the Pacific Northwest's premier expert whitewater runs — 55 miles of continuous Class IV-V through remote desert canyon. No lottery, no crowds, just serious whitewater in true wilderness.

## Overview

From Three Forks to Rome, the Middle Owyhee drops through some of the most challenging whitewater in Oregon. Widowmaker, Shark's Tooth, Bombshelter Drop — the names tell the story. This is expert territory.

## The Experience

The Middle Owyhee is for those who've earned their stripes on other Class IV-V rivers. The rapids are continuous, the canyon is remote, and help is very far away. When conditions align, it's one of the best expert runs in the West.

## When to Go

**March-May:** The only season. Very short window.

**Limited:** May not run most years. Check flows carefully.

## Permit Strategy

Self-issue at put-in. 100% success rate — if you're qualified to run it.

## Special Considerations

- ⚠️ EXPERT ONLY — Class IV-V continuous. Mandatory portages possible.
- Extremely remote — helicopter evacuation only
- Very short season — flow dependent
- Small groups only — limited camping
- One of the Northwest's best expert runs
