# Colorado River — Westwater Canyon

Westwater Canyon is the perfect introduction to permitted overnight river trips. At just 11 miles with solid Class III-IV whitewater, it packs a lot into a short stretch and is attainable for most paddlers with flexibility.

## Overview

Westwater cuts through ancient Precambrian rock — some of the oldest exposed rock on Earth — creating a dark, dramatic canyon with excellent whitewater. The rapids are concentrated in the middle miles, with flatwater on either end.

## The Experience

Westwater is a quick hit of adventure. Launch in the morning, hit the rapids by midday, and either camp for the night or paddle out to Cisco. The whitewater is legitimate — Room of Doom is named for its dangerous undercut wall, and high water makes everything bigger.

## When to Go

**April-June:** Higher flows. More powerful rapids.

**July-October:** Lower but still runnable. Warmer.

## Permit Strategy

Westwater uses a phone reservation system:

- Call (435) 259-7012 M-F 8am-noon
- Reservations available up to 2 months in advance
- ~80% success rate with flexibility

## Special Considerations

- Excellent 1-night trip — perfect for weekend warriors
- Room of Doom: Stay right. The left wall is undercut and has killed people.
- Often combined with Ruby/Horsethief upstream for a 4-day trip
- Phone-only permit system (not Recreation.gov)
