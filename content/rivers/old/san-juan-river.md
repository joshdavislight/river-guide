# San Juan River

The San Juan River offers the best archaeology of any river trip in the Southwest. Ancestral Puebloan ruins, petroglyphs, and granaries dot the canyon walls, and the famous Goosenecks provide some of the most dramatic meanders on Earth.

## Overview

The San Juan flows from the mountains of Colorado through the Four Corners region to Lake Powell. The permitted section from Sand Island to Clay Hills offers 83 miles of desert canyon, manageable Class II-III whitewater, and incredible archaeological sites.

## The Experience

This is an archaeology river. Around every bend are reminders of the people who lived here centuries ago — from obvious cliff dwellings to subtle petroglyphs. The Goosenecks section features entrenched meanders that double back on themselves, adding miles to your journey while you stay in sight of where you camped the night before.

The whitewater is friendly — Government Rapid is the main Class III, and most of the river is Class I-II floating.

## When to Go

**April-May:** Best flows. Cooler temps.

**June:** Still runnable but getting hot.

**July:** End of lottery season. Hot.

**Off-season:** Year-round with advance reservation.

## Permit Strategy

At ~3.5% odds with 12,000 applicants:

- Apply in December-January via Recreation.gov
- Year-round permits available outside lottery season with advance reservation
- Shorter Sand Island to Mexican Hat section (26 mi) is good for 2-day trips

## Special Considerations

- Incredible Ancestral Puebloan sites — look but don't touch or climb on ruins
- Navajo Nation land on river left — permit required for camping/hiking on that side
- Flash flood awareness — don't camp in drainages
- Shorter section (Sand Island to Mexican Hat, 26 mi) is a good 2-day option
