# Tuolumne River

The Tuolumne is one of California's finest Class IV-V runs, featuring the legendary Clavey Falls — a mandatory Class V rapid that serves as the gateway to the lower canyon. This is not a river for learning; it's a destination for experienced whitewater boaters.

## Overview

Flowing from Meral's Pool to Ward's Ferry, the Tuolumne offers 18 miles of continuous Class IV+ whitewater through the Sierra Nevada foothills. Clavey Falls, where the Clavey River enters, is the marquee rapid — a significant Class V with no portage option.

## The Experience

The Tuolumne is relentless. From put-in to take-out, the river demands attention. The rapids are technical and continuous, the water is cold Sierra snowmelt, and Clavey Falls is a legitimate expedition-level rapid.

When you nail the line at Clavey, it's one of the great feelings in California rafting.

## When to Go

**April-June:** Snowmelt season. Best flows.

**July:** Dropping flows. More technical.

**Short season:** Usually done by July.

## Permit Strategy

Self-registration at put-in. Limited group launches. ~90% success rate.

## Special Considerations

- ⚠️ ADVANCED ONLY — Clavey Falls is mandatory Class V. No portage.
- Cold water year-round — drysuits recommended
- Lumsden Road access is rough — high clearance vehicle
- Short season — snowmelt dependent
- One of California's best Class IV-V runs
