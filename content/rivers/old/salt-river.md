# Salt River (Upper Salt)

The Upper Salt River offers a river experience like nowhere else — Class III-IV whitewater through Sonoran Desert canyon, surrounded by saguaro cactus and desert wildlife. It's one of the most unique multi-day trips in America.

## Overview

The Salt River flows from the White Mountains through a rugged desert canyon to the Phoenix area. The permitted section from First Campground to Highway 288 offers 52 miles of wilderness river through a landscape of saguaros, ocotillos, and dramatic canyon walls.

## The Experience

This is desert river running at its finest. The canyon walls are studded with saguaro cactus, the water is often clear green, and the wildlife — javelina, bighorn sheep, eagles — adds to the otherworldly feel.

The whitewater is legitimate Class III-IV, and the river has a unique characteristic: it gets harder at lower water. As flows drop, rocks expose and technical moves become more demanding.

## When to Go

**March-April:** The only season. Snowmelt from the White Mountains creates a brief window.

**May:** Season ends by mid-May most years.

**Dry years:** River may not run at all.

## Permit Strategy

At ~10-15% odds:

- Apply in December-January via Recreation.gov
- 4 launches per day during season
- Check snowpack forecasts before applying — dry years may not have a season

## Special Considerations

- Very short season: March 1 - May 15 only
- Freeflowing river — dry years may not run
- Put-in on White Mountain Apache Reservation — tribal permit may be required
- Gets harder at low water (unusual characteristic)
- Saguaro cactus landscape is unlike any other river trip
