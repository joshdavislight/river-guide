# John Day River

The John Day is the longest undammed river in Oregon, offering 147 miles of mellow floating through colorful high desert canyon. With no whitewater to speak of, it's perfect for families and beginners looking for a multi-day adventure.

## Overview

From Service Creek to Cottonwood Bridge (or Clarno for a shorter trip), the John Day meanders through painted hills and basalt canyons. The rapids max out at Class II, making this an excellent choice for first-time multi-day boaters.

## The Experience

The John Day is about the journey, not the adrenaline. The current carries you through ever-changing scenery — from open rangeland to deep basalt canyons. The fishing is excellent (smallmouth bass), camps are plentiful, and the night skies are spectacular.

## When to Go

**March-June:** Best flows. Spring is prime time.

**Summer:** Often too low by July. Very hot.

## Permit Strategy

Boater Pass required — available at local stores (Service Creek Stage Stop) or self-issue at put-in. 100% success rate.

## Special Considerations

- Longest undammed river in Oregon
- Painted Hills National Monument nearby — worth a side trip
- Excellent smallmouth bass fishing
- Clarno alternate put-in shortens trip to ~70 miles
- Very family-friendly — no significant whitewater
