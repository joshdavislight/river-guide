# Middle Fork Flathead River

The Middle Fork Flathead is a Wild and Scenic River along Glacier National Park's southern boundary, offering good Class II-III whitewater with an optional fly-in start for added wilderness character.

## Overview

From Bear Creek (or fly-in to Schafer Meadows) to West Glacier, the Middle Fork offers 46 miles of scenic canyon with legitimate Class III rapids. Bonecrusher is the marquee rapid, especially at high water.

## The Experience

The Middle Fork offers more whitewater than its northern sibling while maintaining the stunning Glacier NP scenery. The fly-in option to Schafer Meadows adds remote wilderness character and extends the trip to 5 days.

## When to Go

**June-August:** Best weather. Good flows.

**September:** Lower water. More technical.

## Permit Strategy

No permit required. Camp on wilderness land.

## Special Considerations

- Fly-in option from Schafer Meadows adds wilderness experience
- Wild and Scenic River designation
- Glacier National Park boundary along the river
- Bonecrusher at high water is legitimate — scout it
- Grizzly country — bear safety essential
