# Grande Ronde River

The Grande Ronde flows through beautiful basalt canyon on the Oregon-Washington border, offering friendly Class II-III whitewater and excellent steelhead fishing. With no lottery and self-issue permits, it's a reliable backup when Idaho rivers don't pan out.

## Overview

From Minam to Heller Bar (where it meets the Snake River), the Grande Ronde offers 46 miles of scenic canyon floating. Martin's Misery is the marquee Class III, but most of the river is friendlier fare.

## The Experience

The Grande Ronde feels like a smaller, more intimate version of the Idaho rivers. The basalt canyon is dramatic, the camps are excellent, and the steelhead fishing draws anglers from across the Northwest.

## When to Go

**April-June:** Best flows. Spring is prime time.

**Summer-Fall:** Lower flows but still runnable. Steelhead runs in fall.

## Permit Strategy

Self-issue at put-in. 100% success rate.

## Special Considerations

- Often combined with Lower Salmon for a longer trip (both end at Heller Bar)
- Excellent steelhead fishery
- Minam Store offers shuttle services
- Cold water early season — drysuits recommended
- Good backup when Four Rivers lottery fails
