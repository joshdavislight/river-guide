# Colorado River – Westwater Canyon

Westwater Canyon is the perfect introduction to permitted overnight river trips—just 11 miles with solid Class III-IV whitewater packed into a dramatic canyon of ancient Precambrian rock. Short enough for a quick weekend hit, accessible enough for intermediate paddlers, and exciting enough to feel like a real adventure.

The rapids are concentrated in the inner gorge (miles 4-8), with flatwater on either end. Room of Doom's undercut wall demands respect, and high water makes everything significantly bigger.

## When to Go

### April-May (8,000-18,000 cfs)
Spring runoff brings the biggest water and most powerful rapids. Skull Rapid develops huge waves that can swallow rafts. Room of Doom's hole becomes a genuine hazard. This is when Westwater feels most serious. Water is cold from snowmelt (low 50s°F).

### June-August (6,000-12,000 cfs)
Mid-season offers the sweet spot for most paddlers. Rapids are still substantial but more manageable. Water warms slightly (mid-50s to low 60s°F). This is the busiest season with good reason—perfect flows and reliable weather.

### September-October (5,000-8,000 cfs)
Fall brings lower but still runnable flows. Rapids become more technical and less forgiving. Beautiful weather, fewer crowds, and excellent camping temps. This is many guides' favorite season.

### When NOT to Go

**Above 18,000 cfs:** Westwater transforms into legitimate big-water territory at high flows. Skull Rapid develops massive holes and towering waves. Room of Doom's undercut wall becomes less visible and more dangerous. Multiple commercial trips have flipped boats above 18,000 cfs. Unless you're comfortable with serious high-water Class IV, wait for flows to moderate.

**Room of Doom at ANY flow above 10,000 cfs:** Above 10,000 cfs, the hydraulic at the bottom of Room of Doom's left-side undercut becomes powerful enough to hold boats and swimmers. People have died here by getting pinned against the undercut wall. The ONLY safe line is far right, avoiding the left wall entirely. Scout this rapid and understand the consequences.

## Permit Strategy

Westwater uses a reservation system through [Recreation.gov](https://www.recreation.gov/permits/621744) opening 60 days in advance. Book online or call (877) 444-6777. With flexibility on dates, success rate runs around 80%. Weekend launches are more competitive than weekdays.

**Permit Realities:**

Permits are straightforward and predictable. Book exactly 60 days out when the reservation window opens. The system is first-come, first-served—no lottery, no points, just be online when reservations open. Popular dates (Friday/Saturday launches, May-June) fill within hours, so set a reminder and book immediately when your 60-day window opens.

**Often combined with Ruby/Horsethief:** Many groups book Ruby/Horsethief (days 1-2) and Westwater (days 3-4) back-to-back for a complete 4-day Colorado River experience. This gives you scenic floating through Ruby/Horsethief followed by legitimate whitewater through Westwater. Book both permits together.

## Special Considerations

- ⚠️ **Room of Doom's undercut left wall has killed people** - This is not hyperbole or exaggeration. At mile 6, Room of Doom features a dangerous undercut wall on river-left that has trapped and drowned swimmers. The correct line is FAR RIGHT, away from the undercut. Scout from the right bank. Even at moderate flows, getting pushed into the left wall can be fatal. Every commercial outfitter and experienced private boater knows this rapid's history. Respect it.
- 🪨 **Ancient Precambrian rock is some of Earth's oldest** - Westwater's inner gorge exposes 1.7-billion-year-old Precambrian rock—the same dark, metamorphic rock you see in the Grand Canyon's inner gorge. This is some of the oldest exposed rock on the planet. The black and dark red walls create a dramatic, otherworldly setting unlike any other section of the Colorado River.
- 🌊 **Skull Rapid (mile 7) is the biggest** - Just downstream from Room of Doom, Skull Rapid delivers the biggest waves on the run. At high water (above 15,000 cfs), Skull creates room-sized holes and waves that can flip rafts and eat kayakers. It's named "Skull" for good reason—the rocks at the top of the rapid historically looked like a skull (though recent floods have changed the formation).
- 🏕️ **Excellent overnight camping in the canyon** - Big Hummer (mile 5) and Little Hummer (mile 5.5) are the most popular camps, with sandy beaches and good access. Miner's Cabin (mile 7) offers historical interest with remains of old prospector structures. Most groups camp between miles 5-7, running the flatwater to Cisco on day two.
- 🚣 **Perfect weekend warrior trip** - At 11 miles, Westwater is short enough to complete in a long day (6-8 hours) or split into a relaxed overnight. Most groups put in Friday afternoon, camp one night, and takeout Saturday. This makes it ideal for working folks who can't take extended time off.
- 🏔️ **Often combined with Ruby/Horsethief for 4-day trip** - Many paddlers run Ruby/Horsethief (25 miles, 2 days) immediately before Westwater (11 miles, 2 days) for a complete 36-mile, 4-day Colorado River journey. This gives you mellow scenic floating followed by exciting whitewater. The Westwater put-in is at the Ruby/Horsethief takeout, making logistics seamless.
- 🚗 **Shuttle services are abundant and professional** - Multiple shuttle companies operate between Westwater and Cisco. Expect $40-60 per vehicle. Services are reliable and experienced. Many also offer shuttles for combined Ruby/Horsethief-Westwater trips.
- ❄️ **Cold water in spring/early summer** - Snowmelt keeps water temps in the 50s through June. A swim in cold water can lead to hypothermia quickly. Dress for immersion and have dry clothes accessible.
- 📵 **Limited cell service in canyon** - Once you enter the inner gorge (mile 4), cell service disappears. You're on your own until takeout at Cisco. Bring satellite communication if you want emergency contact capability.
