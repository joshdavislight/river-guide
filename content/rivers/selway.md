# Selway River

The Selway is the crown jewel of Idaho whitewater—a pristine, challenging wilderness river that rewards skilled paddlers with an unmatched backcountry experience. This is not a river for beginners; it demands respect and solid Class IV skills.

## Overview

Flowing 47 miles through the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness, the Selway drops through continuous technical whitewater in a canyon so remote that helicopter is the only evacuation option. The rapids are relentless, the scenery is stunning, and the experience is unforgettable.

## The Experience

The Selway offers something increasingly rare: true wilderness solitude. With only one launch per day permitted, you'll likely have the river to yourself. The fishing is exceptional (catch-and-release for native westslope cutthroat), wildlife is abundant, and the rapids will test your skills every mile.

## When to Go

**Peak season (June):** Snowmelt creates optimal flows. Cold but exciting.

**Early season (May):** High and pushy. For experts only.

**Late season (July):** Lower, more technical. Warmer but scrappier.

## Permit Strategy

The Selway has the most brutal permit system in the country: a phone lottery at 9 AM on June 1st where you have minutes to secure one of 62 permits. Tips:
- Have multiple people calling
- Use a landline if possible
- Be flexible on dates
- Practice your phone skills beforehand
