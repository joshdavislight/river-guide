# Snake River — Hells Canyon

Hells Canyon is the deepest gorge in North America — deeper than the Grand Canyon. The Snake River carves through dramatic basalt cliffs on the Idaho-Oregon border, offering solid Class III-IV whitewater with the best lottery odds of the Four Rivers system.

## Overview

At over 7,900 feet deep, Hells Canyon is a geological wonder. The river section from Hells Canyon Dam to Heller Bar offers 34 miles of desert canyon, Native American history, historic ranches, and good whitewater.

## The Experience

Hells Canyon delivers reliable whitewater in a dramatic setting. Wild Sheep Rapid is the marquee Class IV, a legitimate rapid that demands attention. The rest of the run features solid Class III whitewater with excellent camps.

The downsides are real: jet boat traffic can be intrusive, the dam's bathtub ring is visible, and summer temps can be brutal. But the canyon itself is magnificent.

## When to Go

**May-June:** Higher flows. More manageable temps.

**July-August:** Peak summer heat. Plan for shade and early starts.

**September:** Cooling temps. Lower but runnable flows.

## Permit Strategy

At ~4% odds (1 in 25), Hells Canyon has the best odds of the Four Rivers lottery:

- Still competitive but more attainable
- Apply in December-January via Recreation.gov
- Good backup if you strike out on Middle Fork or Main Salmon

## Special Considerations

- Dam-controlled flows = reliable water all season
- Jet boat traffic mainly between camps — they typically don't run rapids
- Historic Kirkwood Ranch and Museum is worth a stop
- Can be combined with Lower Salmon or Grande Ronde at Heller Bar
- Native American sites throughout — respect and don't disturb
