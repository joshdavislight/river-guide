# Lower Salmon River

The Lower Salmon picks up where the Main Salmon ends, continuing 54 miles to Heller Bar on the Snake River. This is Idaho's accessible big-water finale—no lottery, no fees, just solid Class III-IV whitewater through deep canyon.

With a free self-issue permit and no competition, the Lower Salmon is often combined with the Main Salmon for an epic 7+ day wilderness journey. As a standalone trip, it's a rowdy 3-4 day run with one critical concern: Slide Rapid becomes unrunnable above 18,000 cfs.

## When to Go

### May-June (8,000-18,000 cfs)
Peak runoff season brings big water and powerful hydraulics. Slide Rapid is at its most technical but still runnable. High flows create huge wave trains and pushy holes throughout the canyon.

### July-September (6,000-12,000 cfs)
More moderate flows make Slide Rapid more forgiving while maintaining good whitewater throughout. Late summer brings warmer water temperatures and easier camping logistics.

### When NOT to Go

**Above 18,000 cfs:** Slide Rapid becomes unrunnable—a genuine hazard that requires waiting for flows to drop or portaging. Multiple trip reports describe groups camping above Slide for days waiting for the river to come down enough to safely run it.

**Late September-October:** Water gets extremely cold from snowmelt. Hypothermia becomes a serious concern with any swim. Air temps can also drop significantly in the canyon.

## Permit Strategy

Self-issue permit available at the BLM Cottonwood office or various local businesses in Riggins, White Bird, and surrounding areas. Pick up your permit, fill it out, drop it in the box at the put-in. Free and guaranteed—100% success rate.

**Permit Realities:**

No restrictions, no competition, no drama. The Lower Salmon's self-issue system is as straightforward as it gets. Group size maximum is 30 people, which accommodates even large commercial trips or multi-family outings.

## Special Considerations

- ⚠️ **Slide Rapid is THE concern** - At mile 8, this Class IV rapid becomes unrunnable above 18,000 cfs. Scout from the left bank. If it looks too big, wait it out or portage on river-left. Multiple groups have been stuck above Slide for 2-3 days waiting for flows to drop. Plan accordingly and check the White Bird gauge before launching.
- 🌊 **Bigger water than Main or Middle Fork** - The Lower Salmon picks up volume from the Main Salmon plus several tributaries. Wave trains are bigger, holes are more powerful, and the river moves fast. Don't underestimate it just because the permit is free.
- 🛶 **Often combined with Main Salmon** - Putting in at Corn Creek and taking out at Heller Bar creates a 7-8 day epic wilderness journey through over 130 miles of Idaho canyon. This combination is one of the West's classic multi-day trips.
- 🏕️ **Excellent camping throughout** - Numerous sandy beaches provide good camp options. Pine Bar and Blue Canyon are popular, but you'll find many smaller beaches that work well for groups of various sizes.
- 🚗 **Heller Bar takeout is shared** - This is where Grande Ronde River and Hells Canyon trips also finish. On busy weekends, the boat ramp can be a zoo with multiple commercial trips and private parties all converging. Plan extra time for takeout logistics.
- 🎣 **Fishing can be excellent** - Steelhead in spring and fall, smallmouth bass in summer. Idaho fishing license required. Check current regulations as some sections have special rules.
- ❄️ **Cold water in spring** - Even in late May and June, water temperatures stay in the 40s and low 50s. Dress for immersion and have proper cold-water gear. A swim in June can lead to hypothermia quickly.
