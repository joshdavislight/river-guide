The Dolores is the "Feast or Famine" river of the West—the ultimate gamble in river running. When McPhee Dam releases water (typically once every 3-5 years), it's one of the finest desert canyon trips anywhere with stunning red rock scenery, excellent whitewater, and genuine wilderness character. When it doesn't release, there's simply no river trip at all. From Bradfield Bridge in Colorado to Bedrock, Slickrock, or Dewey Bridge in Utah, the Dolores offers up to 150 miles of spectacular desert canyon when flows permit.

When the Dolores runs, it's magic—the canyon walls glow in shades of red and orange reminiscent of the Grand Canyon, the whitewater is excellent with Snaggletooth and Stateline providing memorable Class IV moments, and the isolation is profound. But the river is entirely dependent on McPhee Dam releases, which occur only when the reservoir is full enough to require spilling. Those releases are not guaranteed, creating a boom-or-bust cycle where the river may go years without adequate flows. For those willing to gamble and stay flexible, catching the Dolores in a good year is a lottery win worth more than any permit.

## When to Go

**April-May:** Early season if McPhee releases happen. Flows typically 2,000-5,000 cfs. Cooler temps (60-80°F), potential for rain/snow. Vegetation is green, wildflowers blooming.

**Memorial Day Weekend:** Often peak releases if they occur. Flows 3,000-6,000 cfs. This is THE window historically. Warm temps (70-90°F), high demand.

**June:** Late season if releases continue. Flows dropping (1,500-3,000 cfs). Getting hot (85-100°F). Vegetation drying out.

### When NOT to Go

**Any year McPhee Reservoir doesn't spill:** This is the hard truth—the Dolores typically runs once every 3-5 years when snowpack is exceptional. In drought years or average snowpack years, McPhee Dam doesn't release enough water for a viable trip. You're gambling on weather patterns months in advance. Check snowpack data obsessively starting in January.

**After peak releases end:** Once McPhee stops releasing, flows drop rapidly below 1,000 cfs within days. The river becomes unrunnable—shallow, rocky, tedious. Don't chase falling water.

**Low snow years (below 100% of normal):** If snowpack is below average by March, the Dolores likely won't run that year. Accept reality early and make alternate plans rather than hoping for a miracle.

## Permit Strategy

[Utah section (Gateway to Dewey) requires BLM permit](https://www.recreation.gov/permits/621749). Colorado sections have varying requirements. Approximately 50% success rate during years when the river actually runs. Tips:
- Monitor McPhee Reservoir levels starting in January
- Be ready to book permits immediately when releases are announced (usually 2-4 weeks notice)
- Have backup rivers planned—the Dolores may not happen
- Join online forums (Mountain Buzz) where release predictions are discussed
- Call BLM Moab Field Office: (435) 259-7012 for current permit info

**Permit Realities:**
- **You're gambling months in advance:** Apply for permits in winter/early spring before knowing if the river will even run. If it doesn't run, you've wasted planning time. This is the Dolores reality.
- **When it runs, demand is INTENSE:** Every boater in the West wants to run the Dolores in a release year. Permits disappear immediately. Be ready to act fast.
- **Sections have different permit requirements:** Upper sections (Colorado) may be less regulated than Utah sections. Research which sections require which permits.
- **River running community mobilizes quickly:** When McPhee releases are announced, the grapevine activates. You need to be plugged into that network (Mountain Buzz forums, local outfitters) to get advance notice.

## Special Considerations

- 💧 **EXTREMELY flow dependent—monitor obsessively** - Check USGS gauge #09169500 (Dolores at Dolores) daily. Check McPhee Reservoir levels via Bureau of Reclamation. The difference between a great trip and no trip is measured in weeks, not months. When releases are announced, you have a narrow window.
- 🌊 **Stateline Rapid is a mile-long Class IV gauntlet** - At optimal flows (2,000-4,000 cfs), Stateline (mile 60, CO/UT border) is a nearly mile-long continuous Class IV with multiple holes, rocks, and no clear channels. It's technical, committing, and has claimed boats every year it runs. Scout thoroughly from right bank.
- 🌊 **Snaggletooth Rapid at high water** - Above 4,000 cfs, Snaggletooth (mile 20) has a nasty hole/pour-over that's difficult to avoid. Multiple wraps and pins reported. Scout on left, run carefully.
- 🏕️ **Overgrown camps from years of non-use** - Since the Dolores runs infrequently, camps get overgrown with tamarisk, Russian olive, and brush. Bring pruning shears and a saw. Expect to spend 30+ minutes clearing camp spots. Not the "pull up and relax" experience of frequently-run rivers.
- 🚣 **Expect crowds during release years** - When it runs, EVERYONE goes. You'll encounter 10-12 occupied camps at dusk just trying to find a spot. Memorial Day weekend is especially packed. If you value solitude, this isn't it during release years.
- 🪨 **Rockfall Rapid has nasty pin spots** - Multiple narrow channels with undercut rocks. Very easy to wrap or pin boats. Scout carefully and pick clean lines.
- 🔥 **Fire hazard from dried vegetation** - Years without flow create massive amounts of dried plant material. A misplaced ember could trigger a significant fire. Be extremely cautious with campfires and cooking gear.
- 🌡️ **Can be brutally hot by late season** - June temps regularly exceed 95-100°F in the deep canyon. Minimal shade at many camps. If releases extend into late June, prepare for serious heat.
- 🚗 **Shuttle logistics are complex** - Multiple put-in and takeout options (Bradfield to Bedrock, Gateway to Dewey, etc.) with long dirt road shuttles. Coordinate carefully with shuttle services. Roads can be rough.
- 📡 **Limited cell service** - Much of the canyon is remote with no service. Carry satellite communicator.
- ⏰ **The waiting game** - Many boaters apply for Dolores permits every year for a decade before catching it. Be patient, stay flexible, and have backup plans. When it finally runs, it's worth the wait.
