# North Fork Flathead River

The North Fork Flathead flows along Glacier National Park's western boundary, offering 59 miles of mellow floating through water so clear it seems bottomless. This isn't a whitewater trip—it's a scenic journey through grizzly country with no permit required and mountains that will make your jaw drop.

If you're looking for adrenaline, go elsewhere. If you want pristine wilderness, crystal-clear water, and the very real possibility of seeing grizzly bears, moose, and eagles, the North Fork delivers.

## When to Go

### June-July (4,000-10,000 cfs)
Higher flows make for easier floating with less maneuvering around rocks. Snow still visible on peaks. Water is numbingly cold. Grizzlies are active, especially near salmon spawning areas.

### August (3,000-6,000 cfs)
More moderate flows. Better weather, warmer days, but water stays glacially cold. Prime time for most paddlers. Still plenty of water to float comfortably.

### When NOT to Go

**September-October:** Flows can drop below 2,000 cfs, turning the float into a rock-dodging exercise. While fall colors are beautiful and grizzlies are active feeding before hibernation, low water makes the river frustrating. Water remains dangerously cold even as air temps cool.

**Early June at high water (above 12,000 cfs):** The river moves fast with cold, pushy current. While there's no technical whitewater, the speed and volume can be intimidating for less experienced paddlers. Limited opportunities to pull over if needed.

## Permit Strategy

No permit required. Camp on National Forest land on a first-come basis. Show up and go—no lottery, no fees, no restrictions.

## Special Considerations

- 🐻 **This is SERIOUS grizzly country** - Not a hypothetical concern. Grizzlies are common along the North Fork. Multiple encounters per trip are possible. Bear-proof food storage is mandatory (use bear canisters or hang food properly 12+ feet high and 6+ feet from tree trunks). Carry bear spray and know how to use it. Make noise while hiking and at camps.
- 💎 **Water clarity is extraordinary** - The North Fork is glacial meltwater filtered through rock and forest. Visibility can exceed 20 feet in calm pools. You'll see every rock, log, and fish. This also means any trash or waste is highly visible—practice immaculate Leave No Trace ethics.
- 🏔️ **Glacier National Park boundary** - The eastern bank is Glacier NP for much of the run. You can't camp on the park side without a backcountry permit (which must be obtained separately and is difficult to get). Camp on the west bank (National Forest land) only.
- ❄️ **Water is dangerously cold year-round** - Even in August, water temps are in the low 50s. In June, it's in the 40s. A flip or swim means immediate cold-water shock. Dress for immersion. Have dry clothes and warm layers accessible. Cold-water drowning is a real risk.
- 🚣 **No whitewater challenge** - Class II maximum. This is a scenic float, not a whitewater trip. If you're looking for adrenaline or technical paddling, this isn't your river. Bring fishing rods, cameras, and binoculars instead.
- 🏕️ **Primitive camping only** - No designated camps. Find flat ground on National Forest land above high water. Groups should stay small and dispersed. Practice Leave No Trace principles religiously—this is pristine wilderness.
- 🚗 **Limited access points** - Few roads reach the river. Once you're on the water, you're committed to reaching the takeout. Plan carefully and know your exit points in case of emergency.
- 📵 **No cell service** - You're on your own out here. Bring communication devices (satellite phone or inReach) if you want emergency contact capability.
