# Chattooga River

The Chattooga is the "Deliverance" river — made famous by the 1972 film. It's the best overnight river trip in the Southeast, with Section III offering great family whitewater and Section IV providing serious Class IV-V for experts.

## Overview

Flowing along the Georgia-South Carolina border, the Chattooga offers 50+ miles of Wild and Scenic River. Section III (Highway 28 to Earl's Ford) is a classic intermediate run. Section IV (Earl's Ford to Lake Tugaloo) is expert territory with multiple Class V rapids.

## The Experience

The Chattooga has a different character than Western rivers — the forest is lush and green, the water is cold and clear, and the rapids are technical. Section III builds confidence; Section IV tests it.

## When to Go

**March-November:** Runnable year-round if there's rain.

**Flow-dependent:** Check the gauge at Clayton.

## Permit Strategy

Free permit via Recreation.gov. 100% success rate.

## Special Considerations

- "Deliverance" river — historical and cultural significance
- Section III: Great family/intermediate run
- Section IV: Expert only — multiple Class V rapids
- ⚠️ Woodall Shoals has caused fatalities — portage recommended
- Cold year-round — wetsuit or drysuit recommended
- Best overnight river trip in the Southeast
