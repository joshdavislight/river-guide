The San Juan River offers the best archaeology of any river trip in the Southwest. Ancestral Puebloan ruins, petroglyphs, and granaries dot the canyon walls at nearly every bend, and the famous Goosenecks provide some of the most dramatic entrenched meanders on Earth. The permitted section from Sand Island to Clay Hills covers 83 miles of high desert canyon with manageable Class II-III whitewater.

This is an archaeology river first, whitewater river second. Around every bend are reminders of the people who lived here 700-1,000 years ago—from obvious cliff dwellings to subtle rock art panels. The Goosenecks section (miles 35-50) features entrenched meanders that double back on themselves, adding miles to your journey while you stay within sight of where you camped. The whitewater is friendly with Government Rapid (Class III) as the main event, making this an excellent family trip or introduction to multi-day river running.

## When to Go

**April-May:** Best flows (2,000-5,000 cfs) from spring runoff. Cooler temps (60-80°F), wildflowers blooming. Prime season for archaeology viewing with good light.

**June:** Still runnable (1,000-3,000 cfs) but getting hot (85-100°F). Flows dropping rapidly. Check gauge closely.

**July:** End of lottery season. Low flows (500-1,500 cfs), very hot (95-110°F). More sandbar scraping.

**Off-season (August-March):** Year-round permits available with advance reservation. Low flows but cooler temps in fall/winter.

### When NOT to Go

**Late June through July:** Flows often drop below 1,000 cfs, creating tedious sandbar scraping and frequent boat dragging. Combined with 100°F+ heat, this timing offers the worst experience. If flows are below 800 cfs by late June, seriously consider postponing.

**March-early April:** Water is cold (40-50°F) and flows can be unpredictable from snowmelt. Limited appeal except for hardcore boaters seeking solitude.

**Monsoon season (July-August):** Flash flood risk increases dramatically. Afternoon thunderstorms can turn dry side canyons into raging torrents within minutes. Never camp in drainage bottoms.

## Permit Strategy

At 3.5% odds with 12,000 applicants, the [San Juan lottery](https://www.recreation.gov/permits/234630) is moderately competitive. Tips:
- Apply in December-January via Recreation.gov
- Year-round permits available outside lottery season (July 16-April 14) with advance reservation
- Shorter Sand Island to Mexican Hat section (26 miles) is good for 2-day trips and doesn't require lottery permit
- Early season dates (April 15-May 15) have best odds due to cold water concerns

**Permit Realities:**
- **Lake Powell backwater is the wild card**: In high water years, Lake Powell reservoir backs up past Clay Hills, potentially extending your trip by 6-10 miles of flatwater rowing. Check reservoir levels before launch.
- **Navajo Nation jurisdiction on river left**: All land on river left (south bank) is Navajo Nation. You need a separate Navajo permit to camp or hike on that side. Most groups stay river right (BLM land) to avoid complications.
- **Designated camps below mile 64**: Below mile 64, camps are designated and assigned to prevent overcrowding near Lake Powell. You can't just pull over anywhere.
- **Shorter section is permit-free**: The upper 26 miles (Sand Island to Mexican Hat) doesn't require a permit and makes an excellent 2-day introduction to the river.

## Special Considerations

- 🏛️ **Archaeological sites are everywhere but FRAGILE** - Look but never touch, climb on, or disturb ruins, rock art, or artifacts. Federal law carries heavy fines and potential jail time. Even touching rock art damages it with oils from your skin. Stay on established trails.
- 🗺️ **Navajo Nation land restrictions** - All river left (south bank) is Navajo Nation. You need a separate permit ($15-25/person) to camp or hike on that side. Most groups avoid the hassle and stay river right on BLM land. Don't assume you can explore both sides.
- ⛈️ **Flash flood danger is REAL** - This is desert canyon country. Afternoon thunderstorms (especially July-August monsoon season) can turn dry side canyons into deadly flash floods within 10-15 minutes. Never camp in drainage bottoms, watch the sky constantly, and have an escape plan.
- 💨 **Afternoon winds are brutal** - Desert heating creates powerful upriver winds by early afternoon. Plan to make miles in the morning (launch by 7-8 AM) and be off the water by 2-3 PM. Fighting headwinds is miserable and slow.
- 🏜️ **Sandbars shift constantly** - At low flows (<1,000 cfs), sandbars become obstacles. You'll frequently need to get out and drag/push boats. This is tedious, hot work. Check flows obsessively before committing to the trip.
- 🌊 **Government Rapid at low water** - Below 1,000 cfs, Government Rapid (mile 26) becomes a technical rock garden requiring precise boat placement. Still Class III but more consequential. Scout on left.
- 💧 **Water quality issues** - The San Juan carries heavy sediment loads, especially during runoff. Water is often muddy and unpalatable even when filtered. Many groups bring drinking water from town or use chemical treatment in addition to filtering.
- ☀️ **Zero shade anywhere** - Desert canyon = no trees. Camps are fully exposed. Bring shade structures (tarps, umbrellas) for cooking and lounging. Sun exposure is relentless.
- 🚗 **Clay Hills takeout is REMOTE** - 4WD recommended for the rough dirt road. In wet conditions, 2WD vehicles get stuck. Shuttle drivers know the roads but plan extra time. Cell service is nonexistent.
- 🎣 **Fishing is marginal** - A few catfish and carp, but the San Juan isn't known for fishing. Focus on the archaeology instead.
