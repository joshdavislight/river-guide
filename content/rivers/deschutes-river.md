# Deschutes River

The Deschutes is Oregon's most popular multi-day river, offering dam-controlled flows, excellent steelhead fishing, good whitewater, and accessible logistics. It's a reliable backup when lottery rivers don't pan out.

## Overview

Flowing 98 miles from Warm Springs to the Columbia River, the Deschutes passes through high desert canyon with consistent flows thanks to upstream dams. Oak Springs is the marquee Class IV, and there's good Class II-III throughout.

## The Experience

The Deschutes is a workhorse river — it runs all season with reliable flows, the camps are first-come (no assignments), and the fishing is excellent. The canyon is desert basalt with good scenery, though it's more accessible than Idaho's wilderness rivers.

## When to Go

**May-June:** Higher flows. Bigger rapids.

**July-August:** Hot. Good fishing.

**September-October:** Cooling temps. Steelhead runs.

## Permit Strategy

Limited Entry Permits via Recreation.gov, released on a rolling basis a few days ahead. 70-85% success rate with flexibility.

## Special Considerations

- Dam-controlled = reliable flows all season
- Excellent steelhead and trout fishery
- Check for fire closures — common in late summer
- Oak Springs is legitimate Class IV — scout it
- Camps are first-come — arrive early for best sites
