The Gates of Lodore was named by John Wesley Powell on his legendary 1869 expedition through the canyons of the Green and Colorado Rivers. Today, this 43-mile section through Dinosaur National Monument offers solid Class III-IV whitewater with a longer, more reliable season than the nearby Yampa thanks to dam-controlled flows from Flaming Gorge Dam. Starting at the dramatic Gates of Lodore—a towering sandstone portal into Lodore Canyon—the river flows through increasingly deep red rock canyon to Echo Park, where it meets the free-flowing Yampa River.

Lodore has a different character than the Yampa: dam-controlled flows mean cold, clear water (45-55°F year-round) and predictable season extending into September. The canyon walls are dramatic Precambrian quartzite and sandstone rising 2,000+ feet above the river. The rapids are legitimate—Hell's Half Mile is a long, technical Class IV boulder garden that demands respect and careful scouting. The Jones Hole side hike to Fremont petroglyphs is a highlight, and Echo Park's confluence with the Yampa offers a powerful sense of the canyon system's scale and geologic history.

## When to Go

**May-June:** Higher flows (3,000-6,000 cfs) from dam releases coordinated with snowmelt. Bigger rapids, more powerful hydraulics. Cool temps (60-80°F), lush vegetation.

**July-August:** More moderate flows (1,500-3,500 cfs). Warmer weather (75-95°F) but water stays cold from dam. Best for families and intermediate boaters.

**September:** Lower flows (1,000-2,500 cfs), end of permit season. Cooling temps (65-85°F), fewer crowds, beautiful light. Rapids become more technical with exposed rocks.

### When NOT to Go

**High water (above 6,000 cfs):** Hell's Half Mile becomes "super pushy" with boaters reporting getting "bounced down channels" and "pinballed through." At 8,000+ cfs, it transitions from technical Class IV to powerful big-water Class IV+. Multiple swims and flips occur every high-water season.

**Early May (below 1,500 cfs):** While still runnable, low flows expose rocks throughout Lodore Canyon making rapids more technical and boat-scraping more frequent. Hell's Half Mile becomes a tedious rock garden requiring constant maneuvering.

**Holiday weekends:** Memorial Day and July 4th see maximum crowding. Echo Park's limited camps get packed with multiple groups.

## Permit Strategy

At 10% odds (1 in 10), [Gates of Lodore has the best odds](https://www.recreation.gov/permits/250014) of any major whitewater permit in the Southwest. Tips:
- Apply in December-January via Recreation.gov  
- Good backup option if you don't win Yampa lottery
- If you win both Yampa and Lodore permits, combine them for an epic 12-14 day trip
- Weekday launches have slightly better odds than weekends

**Permit Realities:**
- **Significantly better odds than Yampa**: While the Yampa is 2.6% odds, Lodore is 10%—nearly 4x better. Many groups apply for both.
- **Can combine with Yampa**: If you win both permits, you can run the Yampa from Deerlodge Park to Echo Park (71 miles), then continue down Lodore to Split Mountain (additional 19 miles from Echo Park). This creates an exceptional 12-14 day trip.
- **Shared takeout with Yampa**: Split Mountain is the standard takeout for both rivers, simplifying logistics if combining trips.
- **Dam flows = no snowpack gambling**: Unlike free-flowing rivers, you don't need to worry about drought years. Flaming Gorge Dam provides reliable flows all season.

## Special Considerations

- 🌊 **Hell's Half Mile is serious business** - Mile 15. This Class IV rapid is nearly a mile of continuous technical whitewater through a boulder field. At high water (6,000+ cfs), it becomes pushy and powerful. At low water (under 1,500 cfs), it's tedious rock-dodging. Scout carefully on river right. Multiple portage/line-up options exist.
- 🌊 **Triplet Falls has a dangerous sieve** - Mile 10. The "Birth Canal" section has a nasty boulder pile/sieve on river right at the bottom that MUST be avoided. Stay left of center. This rapid has caused multiple fatalities and wraps throughout the years. Commonly underestimated—don't be complacent.
- 🌊 **Upper Disaster Falls claimed a life in 2018** - Mile 5. Scout on right. The rapid has changed over time with rockfall and is more technical than many boaters expect. Respect it.
- ❄️ **Cold water year-round from dam** - Flaming Gorge Dam releases water from deep in the reservoir at 45-55°F even in August. Long swims mean hypothermia risk. Wetsuits or dry suits are highly recommended, not optional. Dress appropriately for cold water immersion.
- 🏕️ **Island Park camp has intense wind and bugs** - One of the main camps near Triplet Falls. Exposed to afternoon winds and can have heavy mosquito/gnat pressure in early season. Many groups prefer Wade & Curtis or camps below Triplet.
- 🏛️ **Echo Park is historically significant** - The Yampa-Green confluence at Echo Park was slated for a dam in the 1950s. The successful fight to stop it launched the modern environmental movement. Read up on the history before your trip—it adds depth to the experience.
- 🥾 **Jones Hole side hike is excellent** - 4-mile round trip from Jones Hole creek mouth to Jones Hole National Fish Hatchery. Fremont petroglyphs en route. Well worth the effort if you have time.
- 📦 **Permits are expensive** - At $20/person/day, Lodore permits can add up quickly for larger groups on longer trips. Budget accordingly. A 5-day trip for 12 people = $1,200 in permit fees alone.
- 🚗 **Gates of Lodore put-in is remote** - 35+ miles of dirt road from Dutch John or Vernal. The road is maintained but rough. Budget extra time. Cell service disappears quickly.
- 🛶 **Combine with Yampa for epic trip** - If you win both permits, the combined Yampa + Lodore trip (90 total miles, 12-14 days) is one of the best river adventures in America. Highly recommended if you can swing the time off.
