The Selway is the crown jewel of Idaho whitewater—a pristine, challenging wilderness river that rewards skilled paddlers with an unmatched backcountry experience. This is not a river for beginners; it demands respect and solid Class IV skills at minimum. Flowing 47 miles through the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness, the Selway drops through continuous technical whitewater in a canyon so remote that helicopter is the only evacuation option.

The Selway offers something increasingly rare: true wilderness solitude. With only one launch per day permitted, you'll likely have the river mostly to yourself. The fishing is exceptional (catch-and-release for native westslope cutthroat), wildlife is abundant (moose, elk, black bears, and wolves), and the rapids will test your skills every mile. The scenery is stunning—old-growth cedars, granite cliffs, and crystal-clear water that rivals anything in the Rockies.

## When to Go

**Peak season (June):** Snowmelt creates optimal flows (4,000-8,000 cfs). Cold water (45-55°F) but exciting whitewater. This is the sweet spot for most expert paddlers.

**Early season (May):** High and pushy (6,000-12,000+ cfs). For experts only. Cold water requires dry suits. Rapids become significantly more powerful and continuous.

**Late season (July):** Lower, more technical (2,000-4,000 cfs). Warmer but scrappier. Some rapids become rock gardens. Better fishing but less forgiving whitewater.

### When NOT to Go

**Early May at high water:** Above 10,000 cfs, the Selway becomes a different river—relentless, powerful, and unforgiving. Ladle and Double Drop become extremely difficult, and the continuous nature of the rapids means there's no rest. Multiple expert boaters have had epics at these flows.

**Late July/August:** Below 2,000 cfs, the river becomes a tedious rock-scraping slog with frequent boat dragging. The low water also concentrates fishing pressure and the camps feel less wild.

## Permit Strategy

The Selway has the most brutal permit system in the country: a phone lottery at 9 AM Mountain Time on December 1st where you have minutes to secure one of 62 permits for the entire season. Tips:
- Have multiple people calling on multiple phones
- Use landlines if possible (cell service can be spotty)
- Be flexible on dates—any permit is a win
- Practice your phone skills beforehand
- Have backup dates ready in case your first choice is taken

**Permit Realities:**
- **It's a phone lottery bloodbath**: On December 1st at 9 AM, thousands of people call simultaneously. Lines are busy. You may get through or you may not. It's pure luck and persistence.
- **One launch per day only**: This means only 78 permits total for the entire season (62 days). If you don't get through in the first 30 minutes, you're likely shut out.
- **No cancellation list**: Unlike other rivers, there's no official cancellation list. If someone cancels, the date just goes unfilled.
- **Consider commercial trips**: Several outfitters have Selway permits. It's expensive ($2,500-3,500/person) but guaranteed.

## Special Considerations

- 🌊 **Ladle Rapid is the crux** - Mile 13. This is the most technical rapid on the river and has the most consequential hole. Scout carefully on river right. The line is tight and requires precise boat control. Multiple pins and wraps happen here every season.
- 🌊 **Double Drop is serious** - Mile 24. Two distinct Class IV drops in quick succession. The second drop has a nasty hole at certain flows (5,000-7,000 cfs). Scout on left, run right of center.
- 🪵 **Log jams change annually** - The Selway is notorious for wood. Spring floods rearrange the channel every year. Never assume a rapid is clear—scout anything you can't see around a bend. Multiple fatalities from wood over the years.
- ❄️ **Cold water danger is real** - Even in June, water temps are 45-55°F. A long swim means hypothermia in 10-15 minutes. Dry suits are highly recommended, not optional. Throw ropes and rescue skills are essential.
- 🚁 **Helicopter evacuation only** - There are no roads to the river. If someone gets seriously injured, the only option is helicopter evacuation via Moose Creek airstrip (mile 15) or Paradise Guard Station. Carry a satellite communicator.
- 🐻 **Bear canisters required** - Black bears are common. Canisters are mandatory for food storage. The Forest Service is serious about this—rangers patrol and will cite you.
- 🎣 **Fishing regulations are strict** - Westslope cutthroat are native and protected. Catch-and-release only, barbless hooks, no bait. Rangers check licenses.
- 🏕️ **Limited camp options** - With only 47 miles and continuous whitewater, camp selection is limited. Plan your daily mileage carefully—you can't just pull over anywhere.
- ⚠️ **No room for error** - The Selway is continuous Class IV with serious consequences. If you're not solid at Class IV, do not attempt this river. Multiple swims or flips would be exhausting and dangerous.
