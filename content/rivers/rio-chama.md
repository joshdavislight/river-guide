# Rio Chama

The Rio Chama is the only Wild and Scenic River in New Mexico, offering a 31-mile desert canyon journey through red rock walls and piñon-juniper forest. It's the Southwest's most accessible permitted multi-day trip.

## Overview

Flowing from El Vado Dam through a sandstone canyon, the Rio Chama provides 2-3 days of floating through scenic high desert. The whitewater is Class II-III, making it suitable for intermediate paddlers and families with some experience.

## The Experience

The Rio Chama has a different character than Utah's big desert rivers — it's more intimate, with closer canyon walls and clear, cold water from El Vado Dam releases. The red and tan sandstone creates a colorful backdrop, and camps are spread throughout the canyon.

## When to Go

**April-June:** Dam releases from El Vado create the season. Peak flows typically April-May.

**July:** End of main season.

**Fall:** Sometimes fall releases occur — check with BLM.

## Permit Strategy

The Rio Chama has an unusual permit system:

- Lottery for Friday/Saturday launches May 1 onwards (postcard application by January 31)
- Other days are first-come
- Before May 1: No permit needed — popular late April strategy
- ~20-30% odds for weekend, easier weekday

## Special Considerations

- Only Wild & Scenic River in New Mexico
- No permit needed before May 1 — popular for late April trips
- Dam-controlled = cold water. Drysuits help early season.
- 3 launches per day during permit season
- Weekdays much easier to get than weekends
