# Rio Chama

The Rio Chama is New Mexico's only Wild and Scenic River, offering 31 miles of desert canyon floating through red rock walls and piñon-juniper forest. Dam-controlled flows from El Vado Dam create a more predictable season than most Southwestern rivers, but that predictability comes with serious permit penalties and flow frustrations.

This is the Southwest's most accessible permitted multi-day trip with friendly Class II-III whitewater, making it popular with intermediate paddlers and families. The challenge isn't the rapids—it's dealing with BOR's flow management and BLM's harsh permit policies.

## When to Go

### April (Late April Often Best)
No permit required before May 1, making late April the most popular launch window. Flows are typically good (800-1,500 cfs) from El Vado Dam releases. Water is cold from dam releases—drysuits help. This is the "loophole" season that avoids lottery competition entirely.

### May-June (800-2,000 cfs)
Peak season with dam releases creating consistent flows. Water remains cold despite warm air temps. Memorial Day weekend is particularly crowded. This is when permits are required and competitive.

### July (400-1,000 cfs)
Late season as irrigation demands increase and releases decrease. Flows can drop to barely runnable levels. Some years the season ends by mid-July.

### When NOT to Go

**Low snow years:** El Vado Dam releases are entirely dependent on upstream snowpack. In drought years, BOR may provide minimal releases or shut off flows completely for downstream irrigation needs. The river can drop from 500 cfs to 80 cfs overnight without warning.

**August-September:** While technically the permit season extends through September, flows are typically too low by August. Irrigation demands drain the river to a trickle. Don't plan late-season trips without obsessively monitoring the gauge.

## Permit Strategy

The Rio Chama has one of the most peculiar permit systems in the West. Apply through the [BLM Rio Chama lottery](https://www.blm.gov/programs/recreation/permits-and-passes/lotteries-and-permit-systems/new-mexico/rio-chama) during January (postcard application by January 31st) for weekend launches May 1st onwards. Results come out around March 1st. Weekday launches are first-come, first-served with much better availability. Odds for weekend launches run around 20-30%.

**Permit Realities:**

**No permit needed before May 1st:** This is the critical loophole. Late April trips require no permit, no reservation, no lottery—just show up and launch. This makes late April the most popular time to run the Chama, avoiding the entire permit system. Many experienced groups exclusively target the April 20-30 window.

**3-YEAR BAN for no-shows:** This is the harshest penalty in Western river permitting. If you win a permit and don't show up (without advance cancellation), BLM bans you from applying for 3 years. This isn't negotiable—medical emergencies, car breakdowns, nothing excuses a no-show without prior notice. Call the BLM office if plans change.

**Dual agency confusion:** The upper 22 miles are BLM-managed (permit required during season), while the lower 9 miles are USFS (no permit ever). Different agencies, different policies for the same river trip. Most people ignore this distinction and just get the BLM permit.

**No cell service to check flows:** Once you commit and launch, you can't check the gauge. If BOR drops releases for irrigation mid-trip, you're committed to dragging boats through shallows. This happened to multiple groups in 2022 when flows dropped from 500 to 100 cfs overnight.

## Special Considerations

- 🌊 **Dam-controlled flows = unpredictable releases** - El Vado Dam releases are managed by BOR for downstream irrigation, not recreation. Releases can change dramatically with little notice. What BLM and BOR communicate to the public is often days behind actual operations. Check the gauge obsessively, but understand even the gauge doesn't predict future releases.
- ❄️ **Cold water year-round from dam** - Even in July, water coming out of El Vado Dam is in the low 50s°F. Early season (April-May), it's in the 40s. Drysuits or thick wetsuits are recommended for safety, especially with the Class II-III rapids that can cause swims.
- 🏜️ **Only Wild & Scenic River in New Mexico** - The Chama's designation protects this beautiful canyon, but it also means strict camping regulations. Camps are designated only—no dispersed camping allowed. Some camps are tiny and exposed.
- 📅 **Late April strategy avoids permits entirely** - This is the insider move: launch April 20-30 before the May 1st permit season starts. Flows are usually good, weather is decent, and you avoid the entire lottery and fee system. Many experienced Chama boaters exclusively run in late April.
- ⚠️ **3-year ban for no-shows is HARSH** - Don't take this lightly. If your group wins a weekend permit and doesn't show, you're banned from applying for 3 years. Make sure your plans are solid before applying, and call BLM immediately if circumstances change. This is the strictest no-show policy of any river permit system.
- 🏕️ **Limited camps in some sections** - Unlike rivers with abundant camping, the Chama has designated camps that vary in quality. Some are spacious with good beaches; others are small, rocky, and exposed. You can't choose your camps—it's first-come once you're on the river.
- 🌡️ **High desert weather extremes** - April can see snow, rain, sun, and wind all in one day. May-June brings hot days (80-90°F) but cold nights (40-50°F). July can hit 100°F during the day. Pack for temperature swings and sudden weather changes.
- 🎣 **Fishing is often underwhelming** - Despite being a Wild & Scenic River, the Chama's fishing doesn't compare to Montana blue-ribbon streams. The cold dam water and desert environment create a limited fishery. Don't plan this trip primarily for fishing.
