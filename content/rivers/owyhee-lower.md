# Owyhee River — Lower Section

The Lower Owyhee is Oregon's Grand Canyon — a spectacular desert river trip with dramatic canyon walls, hot springs, petroglyphs, and no permit lottery to fight. The catch? It only runs when Mother Nature provides enough water.

## Overview

From Rome to Birch Creek (or Leslie Gulch), the Owyhee flows 60 miles through increasingly deep and colorful canyon. The whitewater is friendly Class II-III, making this a great trip for intermediate paddlers.

## The Experience

The Owyhee feels like a secret. The canyon walls tower overhead in shades of red, orange, and brown. Hot springs appear along the banks. Ancient petroglyphs remind you that people have been drawn to this place for thousands of years.

And unlike every other river on this list, you don't need to win a lottery. Self-issue permit at the put-in.

## When to Go

**March-May:** The only season. Snowmelt creates a brief window.

**Check flows:** Need >800 cfs at Rome gauge. May not run in dry years.

## Permit Strategy

Self-issue at put-in. 100% success rate — if it's running.

## Special Considerations

- ⚠️ Flow dependent — check Rome gauge before planning
- Hot springs at several locations along the river
- Petroglyphs — look but don't touch
- Leslie Gulch is an alternate takeout with spectacular scenery
- Very remote — self-rescue situation
