# Illinois River

The Illinois may be the best Class IV-V multi-day raft trip in the West. With crystal-clear water, mandatory Class V rapids, and true wilderness, it's an expert-only destination that delivers an unforgettable experience.

## Overview

From Briggs Creek (or Miami Bar) to Oak Flat, the Illinois flows 31 miles through the Kalmiopsis Wilderness. Green Wall, where the river narrows between moss-covered walls, is the mandatory Class V that defines the trip.

## The Experience

The Illinois is special. The water is extraordinarily clear, the wilderness is pristine, and the whitewater is continuous and challenging. Green Wall is the crux — a committing Class V with no portage option. If you're not comfortable with Class V, this isn't your river.

## When to Go

**February-April:** Rain-dependent season. Best after winter storms.

**May:** Sometimes runnable in wet years.

## Permit Strategy

Self-issue at Ray's Food Place in Selma. 100% success rate — if you're qualified.

## Special Considerations

- ⚠️ EXPERT ONLY — Green Wall is mandatory Class V. No portage.
- Extremely clear water — visible 30+ feet deep
- Very short season — rain dependent
- Cold year-round — drysuits required
- Possibly best Class IV-V multiday raft trip in West
