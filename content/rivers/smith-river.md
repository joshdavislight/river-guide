# Smith River

The Smith River is Montana's crown jewel float trip — a 59-mile journey through a spectacular limestone canyon with world-class trout fishing and no whitewater to speak of. The challenge isn't the rapids; it's getting a permit.

## Overview

The Smith flows through a deep limestone canyon in central Montana. There are no roads in or out once you launch, and camps are assigned, creating an intimate wilderness experience. The river is nationally famous for its brown and rainbow trout fishing.

## The Experience

This is a fishing and floating trip, not a whitewater trip. The rapids max out at Class II, making it accessible to beginners and families. What makes the Smith special is the setting — towering limestone walls, clear water, excellent fishing, and the feeling of true isolation.

Camps are assigned when you pick up your permit, eliminating the competition for sites that plagues other rivers.

## When to Go

**Late April - May:** Early season. Cold but fishable. Higher flows.

**May - June:** Prime season. Warming temps. Good fishing.

**Late June - July:** Lower water. May not be runnable in dry years.

## Permit Strategy

At ~10% odds (8,000+ applicants for 978 permits):

- Apply through Montana FWP (not Recreation.gov)
- January 2 - February 15 lottery window
- Non-residents capped at 10% of permits
- Bonus points favor Montana residents

## Special Considerations

- Pack out human waste required (groover)
- Blue-ribbon trout fishery — catch-and-release encouraged
- Bears are real — carry bear spray and store food properly
- Camps are assigned — no stress about getting good sites
- No whitewater — bring oars and a good book
- Check flows — dry years may not run
