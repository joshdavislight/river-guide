# Klamath River

The Klamath is undergoing the largest dam removal in US history, with four dams removed in 2024. The river is changing — and recovering. Salmon and steelhead are returning to waters they haven't seen in over a century.

## Overview

From the former Iron Gate Dam area to Happy Camp (or further downstream), the Klamath offers 55+ miles of canyon whitewater with no permit required. Hell's Corner provides the main Class IV challenge.

## The Experience

The Klamath in 2024-2025 is a river in transition. The dams are gone, the salmon are returning, and the river is finding its new character. Running the Klamath now is witnessing history — the restoration of one of the West's great salmon rivers.

## When to Go

**May-September:** Best conditions. Check current flows — dam removal has changed release patterns.

## Permit Strategy

No permit required for most stretches. 100% success rate.

## Special Considerations

- 2024 dam removal — largest in US history
- River dynamics are changing — check current conditions
- Salmon and steelhead fishery recovering
- Great opportunity to witness river restoration in action
- Hell's Corner is legitimate Class IV
