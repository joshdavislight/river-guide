# Yampa River

The Yampa is the last major free-flowing tributary of the Colorado River—a spring runoff gem that offers a window into how all Western rivers once ran. Flowing through Dinosaur National Monument, it combines world-class scenery, rich history, and excellent whitewater.

## Overview

From Deerlodge Park to Split Mountain, the Yampa carves 71 miles through spectacular red rock canyons before joining the Green River at Echo Park. The river is free-flowing (no dams), meaning flows are entirely dependent on snowpack—plan accordingly.

## The Experience

The Yampa offers something unique: a free-flowing river experience that's increasingly rare in the dammed West. The canyons are filled with Native American petroglyphs, historic outlaw hideouts, and stunning geology. The highlight is Warm Springs Rapid, formed by a massive debris flow in 1965.

## When to Go

**Peak season (May-early June):** This is THE time to run the Yampa. Snowmelt creates optimal flows, wildflowers bloom, and the river is at its best.

**Late season (July+):** Flows often drop too low for a good experience. Check gauges carefully.

## Permit Strategy

The Yampa permit is competitive but achievable. Tips:
- Apply early in the lottery window
- Be flexible on dates within peak season
- Combine with a Gates of Lodore trip for a longer adventure
- Check cancellation lists starting in April
