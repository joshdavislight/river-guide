The Klamath is undergoing the largest dam removal project in US history, with four dams removed in 2023-2024. The river is fundamentally changing—and recovering—right now. Salmon and steelhead are returning to waters they haven't accessed in over a century, and the river is finding its new post-dam character. From the former Iron Gate Dam area to Happy Camp (or further downstream), the Klamath offers 55+ miles of canyon whitewater with no permit required.

The Klamath in 2025-2026 is a river in transition and restoration. The dams are gone (Iron Gate, Copco 1, Copco 2, and J.C. Boyle removed 2023-2024), salmon are exploring newly accessible habitat, and the river channel is still adjusting to natural flows. Running the Klamath now means witnessing history—the restoration of one of the West's great salmon rivers after 100+ years of disruption. Hell's Corner provides the main Class IV technical challenge, while the rest offers enjoyable Class III whitewater through beautiful canyon.

## When to Go

**May-June:** Spring flows (3,000-6,000 cfs). Cool temps (60-80°F), green canyon, good whitewater. Best season for exciting rapids.

**July-August:** Summer flows (1,500-3,500 cfs). Warm temps (75-95°F), excellent swimming. More moderate whitewater. Good family season.

**September:** Fall flows (1,000-2,500 cfs). Cooling temps (65-85°F), salmon returning, fewer people. Prime time to witness fish recovery.

### When NOT to Go

**During active restoration work (check current status):** Dam removal debris and sediment mobilization created temporarily challenging conditions in 2023-2024. While the major work is complete, some restoration activities may continue. Check with local outfitters for current river status.

**Extreme low water (below 1,000 cfs):** The river becomes very shallow with tedious rock-dodging. Not worth the effort.

**Peak summer heat (late July-August):** Temperatures can exceed 100°F in the canyon. Combined with lower flows, the experience suffers. May-June or September are better timing.

## Permit Strategy

No permit required for most stretches. 100% success rate—just show up and launch. This is one of the Klamath's greatest advantages: **zero permit hassle**.

**Permit Realities:**
- **Truly no permit needed:** Unlike most multi-day California rivers, the Klamath's upper sections require no permits, reservations, or fees. Pure freedom.
- **Some sections may have tribal land considerations:** The Karuk, Yurok, and Hoopa tribes have territory along the river. Respect tribal lands and follow any posted guidelines.
- **River is evolving post-dam removal:** What's true today may change as the river adjusts. Stay connected with local knowledge through outfitters and boating groups.

## Special Considerations

- 🏗️ **Largest dam removal in US history** - Four dams (Iron Gate, Copco 1, Copco 2, J.C. Boyle) removed 2023-2024. This is unprecedented in scale. The river is literally rewriting itself—new channels forming, sediment redistributing, vegetation establishing. You're witnessing ecological restoration in real-time.
- 🐟 **Salmon and steelhead recovery is REAL** - Chinook salmon, coho salmon, and steelhead are already exploring habitat they haven't accessed since the 1900s. Fall 2024 saw fish above the former dam sites for the first time in over a century. This is one of the most significant salmon restoration efforts in history.
- 🌊 **River dynamics still changing** - Dam removal released decades of accumulated sediment. The river channel is still adjusting—rapids shifting, new gravel bars forming, flows redistributing. Check recent trip reports before launching. What was true 6 months ago may have changed.
- 🌊 **Hell's Corner is legitimate Class IV** - Mile 5. This section has multiple technical drops with rocks and holes requiring precise lines. Scout on right. Don't underestimate it just because the rest of the river is more forgiving.
- 🏕️ **Established camps exist but conditions vary** - Tree of Heaven and Sarah Totten campgrounds provide developed camping. Other camps are more primitive. With the river changing post-dam removal, camp quality and access may be evolving.
- 🎣 **Fishing is in recovery mode** - The Klamath was once one of the Pacific's greatest salmon rivers. After decades of decline due to dams and water management, the fishery is rebuilding. Give it time—in 5-10 years, this could be spectacular again. California/Oregon fishing license required.
- 🏛️ **Tribal cultural significance is profound** - The Karuk, Yurok, and Hoopa tribes have depended on Klamath salmon for millennia. Dam removal represents justice and restoration for Native communities. Approach the river with respect for this cultural importance.
- 💧 **Water quality improving** - The dam reservoirs caused warm water temperatures and algae blooms that harmed salmon. With dams gone, water temps are cooling and quality is improving. This benefits both fish and paddlers.
- 📸 **Document this historic moment** - You're floating a river during one of the most significant restoration projects in conservation history. Take photos, keep journals. You'll want to remember this and share it.
- 🚗 **Access is straightforward** - Former Iron Gate Dam area to Happy Camp is well-served by roads and shuttle services. Logistics are simple compared to remote wilderness rivers.
- 🌡️ **Can be hot in summer** - The canyon traps heat. July-August temps often exceed 95°F. Bring shade and plan for swimming breaks.
- ⚠️ **Stay informed on current conditions** - The Klamath is changing rapidly post-dam removal. Before launching, check with local outfitters (Klamath River Outfitters, OARS) for current rapid configurations, camp status, and any access changes.
