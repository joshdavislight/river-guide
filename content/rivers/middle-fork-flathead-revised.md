# Middle Fork Flathead River

The Middle Fork Flathead flows along Glacier National Park's southern boundary, offering legitimate Class II-III whitewater in one of Montana's most spectacular settings. No permit required, optional fly-in access to Schafer Meadows, and the very real presence of grizzly bears make this a true Northern Rockies wilderness experience.

This is whitewater with scenery—Bonecrusher rapid demands respect at high flows, while the peaks of Glacier National Park provide a backdrop that's hard to match anywhere else.

## When to Go

### June-July (4,000-10,000 cfs)
Peak runoff brings the biggest water and most exciting whitewater. Bonecrusher lives up to its name above 8,000 cfs. Snow still caps the peaks, creating dramatic scenery. Water is ice cold—bring serious cold-water gear.

### August (3,000-6,000 cfs)
More moderate flows make rapids more technical and less pushy. Better weather, warmer air temps, but water stays glacially cold. This is the sweet spot for most paddlers.

### When NOT to Go

**Above 12,000 cfs:** Bonecrusher becomes genuinely dangerous with powerful hydraulics and limited scouting opportunities at high water. The riverwide hole at the bottom has held boats and swimmers. Wait for flows to drop if you're not comfortable with solid Class III+ at volume.

**September:** While scenery is beautiful with fall colors beginning, flows typically drop below 2,000 cfs, making the run more rock-dodging than whitewater. Water remains dangerously cold.

## Permit Strategy

No permit required. Camp on National Forest wilderness land on a first-come basis. This is true freedom—show up and go.

## Special Considerations

- ✈️ **Fly-in option to Schafer Meadows** - Charter flights from Kalispell or Missoula add serious wilderness character and extend the trip to 5 days. The upper section from Schafer to Bear Creek is more remote and pristine, though rapids are mellower. Expect to pay $300-400 per person for the flight.
- 🌊 **Bonecrusher demands respect** - At high water (above 8,000 cfs), this Class III+ rapid is the real deal. Scout from the left bank. The riverwide hole at the bottom has flipped rafts and held swimmers. Don't underestimate it just because it's "only" Class III+.
- 🐻 **Serious grizzly country** - This is not theoretical. Grizzlies are active along the river. Proper bear-proof food storage is mandatory (use bear canisters or hang food properly). Carry bear spray and know how to use it. Make noise at camps and while hiking.
- ❄️ **Water is glacially cold year-round** - Even in August, water temps are in the low 50s. In June, it's in the 40s. Dress for immersion. A swim means immediate cold-water shock and rapid onset of hypothermia. Have dry clothes and warm layers accessible.
- 🏔️ **Wild and Scenic River designation** - The Middle Fork is protected, which means pristine surroundings but also means respecting regulations about camps, fires, and waste disposal. Pack it in, pack it out.
- 🏕️ **Limited designated camps** - Unlike Main Salmon or Grand Canyon, camps aren't assigned or even clearly designated. You're camping on wilderness land. Find flat ground above high water, keep groups small, and practice Leave No Trace principles.
- 🚗 **Shuttle logistics are straightforward** - Multiple professional shuttle services operate out of West Glacier. Shuttles run $100-150 per vehicle and are reliable. Book ahead during peak season (July-August).
