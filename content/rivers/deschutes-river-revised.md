The Deschutes is Oregon's most popular multi-day river, offering dam-controlled flows, excellent steelhead fishing, good whitewater, and accessible logistics just 2 hours from Portland. Flowing 98 miles from Warm Springs to Heritage Landing (near the Columbia River), the Deschutes passes through high desert basalt canyon with consistent flows thanks to upstream dams. It's a reliable backup when lottery rivers don't pan out and a solid training ground for building multi-day river skills.

The Deschutes is a workhorse river in the best sense—it runs all season with predictable flows (4,000-6,000 cfs), camps are first-come-first-served (no assignments or racing), and the steelhead/trout fishing is genuinely excellent. Oak Springs is the marquee Class IV rapid that deserves serious respect, and there's consistent Class II-III whitewater throughout. The canyon features striking black basalt cliffs and desert ecology, though it's more accessible and less remote than Idaho's wilderness rivers. The combination of reliability, good fishing, and manageable logistics makes it incredibly popular—expect to see other groups, especially on weekends.

## When to Go

**May-June:** Higher flows (5,000-7,000 cfs) from dam releases coordinated with snowmelt. Bigger rapids, more powerful Oak Springs. Cooler temps (65-85°F), green vegetation. Good steelhead fishing.

**July-August:** Mid-summer flows (4,000-5,500 cfs). Hot temps (85-105°F), excellent swimming. Peak season crowds. Water stays cool from dam releases (55-65°F).

**September-October:** Shoulder season flows (3,500-5,000 cfs). Cooling temps (70-90°F), fall colors, excellent steelhead runs. Fewer crowds. Risk of fire closures.

### When NOT to Go

**Weekends May-September:** The Deschutes is Portland's backyard river trip. Summer weekends see heavy traffic from both private and commercial groups. Camps fill up by mid-afternoon. If you value solitude, go midweek.

**Late August-September during fire season:** The high desert environment is prone to wildfires. In recent years, sections of the Deschutes have closed due to fires, forcing trip cancellations. Check fire status obsessively if planning late-season trips. Air quality from distant fires can also be poor.

**Below 3,500 cfs (rare):** Dam releases keep flows relatively stable, but in extreme drought years flows can drop below ideal. The river is still runnable but becomes more technical with exposed rocks.

## Permit Strategy

[Limited Entry Permits via Recreation.gov](https://www.recreation.gov/permits/234634), released on a rolling basis a few days in advance. Approximately 75-85% success rate with date flexibility. Tips:
- Permits become available 5-7 days before launch date
- Check Recreation.gov daily for your target launch window
- Weekdays are significantly easier to book than weekends
- Be flexible on exact launch date within your target window
- May and September have best availability

**Permit Realities:**
- **Rolling release system requires vigilance** - Unlike lottery rivers where you apply once, the Deschutes requires checking Recreation.gov daily until permits for your dates appear. Set calendar reminders.
- **Weekend permits vanish immediately** - Friday-Sunday launches during summer are extremely competitive. If you need a weekend, be online exactly when permits drop.
- **Sherars Falls is ILLEGAL to run** - Just below Oak Springs rapid is Sherars Falls, a traditional Native American fishing site. Running it is illegal (tribal jurisdiction) and disrespectful. Portage on river right is mandatory. Rangers patrol and will cite violators.

## Special Considerations

- 🌊 **Oak Springs Rapid is legitimate Class IV** - Mile 45. At higher flows (5,000+ cfs), Oak Springs has multiple large holes and requires precise boat placement. Scout thoroughly from river right. The rapid has a reputation for humbling overconfident boaters. Multiple pins and flips every season. Don't underestimate it.
- 🚫 **Sherars Falls portage is MANDATORY** - Mile 46, just below Oak Springs. Sherars Falls is on Warm Springs tribal land and is an active Native American fishing site. Running it is illegal under tribal law. Portage on river right is mandatory. Rangers enforce this strictly—expect citations if you run it.
- 🐍 **Rattlesnakes are everywhere** - High desert environment means rattlesnakes at nearly every camp. Check under gear before packing, wear shoes at night, and watch where you put your hands on shore. Multiple encounters guaranteed on any trip. Learn to identify them and give them space.
- 🌡️ **Extreme heat in summer** - July-August temps regularly exceed 100°F with minimal shade at camps. Bring tarps, umbrellas, and shade structures. Plan for midday swimming and water activities. Heat exhaustion is a risk.
- 🔥 **Fire closures are common** - Late summer fires have closed sections of the Deschutes multiple times in recent years. Check BLM fire restrictions before launch and be prepared for possible evacuation if fires develop during your trip. Carry a satellite communicator.
- 🎣 **Excellent fishing** - World-class steelhead in fall (September-October), good trout year-round. Oregon fishing license required. Regulations are complex (wild vs hatchery, gear restrictions, harvest limits). Study them before your trip.
- 🏕️ **Camps are first-come-first-served** - No assignments or reservations for individual camps. Arrive at camps by 3-4 PM on popular weekends to secure good spots. Camps vary in quality—some are excellent, others are marginal.
- 🚂 **Train noise is constant** - BNSF railroad runs along the river for most of the trip. Freight trains pass every 30-60 minutes, 24/7. Some camps are quieter than others, but complete silence is impossible. Bring earplugs if you're a light sleeper.
- 💨 **Wind can be brutal** - Afternoon headwinds upriver are common. Launch early (7-8 AM) and plan to be off the water or in camp by 2-3 PM. Fighting wind is exhausting.
- 🚗 **Excellent shuttle infrastructure** - Multiple shuttle companies in Maupin and surrounding areas. Reliable, affordable ($25-40/person), professional. Easy logistics.
