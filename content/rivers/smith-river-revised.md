# Smith River

The Smith River is Montana's crown jewel float trip—59 miles through a spectacular limestone canyon with world-class brown and rainbow trout fishing, no technical whitewater, and assigned camps that eliminate site competition. The river itself is mellow Class I-II throughout. The challenge is winning the permit lottery at approximately 10% odds.

This is a fishing and scenic floating trip, not a whitewater adventure. The Smith's value lies in its setting—towering white limestone cliffs, crystal-clear water, complete wilderness isolation, and a blue-ribbon trout fishery that draws anglers from around the world.

## When to Go

### Late April-Early May (500-1,500 cfs)
Early season brings higher flows from snowmelt and the best water levels for floating. Rapids (what few there are) have plenty of cushion. Weather is cold and unpredictable—expect anything from sun to snow. Fishing can be excellent if conditions cooperate, but cold weather often slows trout activity.

### Mid-May through June (400-1,000 cfs)
Prime season with warming temps, good flows, and excellent fishing. This is the sweet spot when weather stabilizes, bugs emerge for trout feeding, and the canyon feels perfect. Water remains cold but manageable.

### Late June-July (300-600 cfs)
Late season as flows taper. In normal years, this is still runnable but requires more attention to avoid rocks. Fishing can be exceptional as trout concentrate in pools. In dry years, flows may drop too low to float comfortably.

### When NOT to Go

**Dry years (below 300 cfs):** The Smith is freeflowing, meaning flows depend entirely on spring runoff. Low-snow winters produce insufficient flows. Below 300 cfs, you'll drag boats over rocks constantly. Check Montana snowpack forecasts before applying. Some years the river simply doesn't run well.

**Above 2,000 cfs:** While the Smith has no dangerous rapids, very high water moves fast and can make controlling boats difficult, especially for less experienced paddlers. High flows also muddy the water, reducing the famous water clarity and making fishing less productive.

## Permit Strategy

Apply through [Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks](https://fwp.mt.gov/activities/floating/smith-river) between January 2nd and February 15th. Results announced February 19th. With approximately 8,000+ applications for 978 permits, odds run around 10-12%. Montana residents get priority through a preference point system, making non-resident odds even lower.

**Permit Realities:**

**Non-residents face harsh odds:** Montana caps non-resident permits at approximately 10% of total permits. If you're from out of state, expect odds closer to 5-8%. The preference point system heavily favors Montana residents who apply year after year. Many non-residents apply for a decade before winning.

**Assigned camps eliminate competition:** When you pick up your permit at Camp Baker, Montana FWP assigns your camps for each night. This is huge—no racing other groups to secure good campsites, no stress about where to stop each day. Your camps are guaranteed and clearly marked. This makes the Smith more relaxed than rivers with first-come camping.

**Mandatory waste pack-out (groover required):** The Smith requires packing out all human waste. Bring a proper portable toilet system (groover). This isn't optional—rangers check at takeout. If you don't have experience with groovers, watch tutorials or hire an outfitter to provide equipment.

**Strict group size limits:** Maximum 15 people per permit. Montana FWP enforces this rigorously. Don't try to sneak extra people—rangers check at both put-in and takeout.

## Special Considerations

- 🐻 **Grizzly and black bears are ACTIVE and common** - The Smith corridor has one of the highest bear encounter rates of any Montana river. Multiple groups per season have bears walk through camps or investigate food storage. Bear-proof food storage is mandatory (use bear canisters or hang food properly 12+ feet high and 6+ feet from tree trunks). Carry bear spray and keep it accessible. Make noise when hiking or in thick vegetation. This isn't theoretical—bears are present.
- 🎣 **Blue-ribbon trout fishery draws anglers worldwide** - The Smith is nationally famous for brown trout fishing. Fish regularly exceed 20 inches, with occasional trophies over 25 inches. Use barbless hooks and practice catch-and-release—this fishery is heavily managed. Montana fishing license required. The best fishing is often in the morning and evening when water temps are cooler.
- 🏕️ **Camps are assigned—no competition for sites** - This is one of the Smith's best features. When you pick up your permit, FWP assigns camps for each night based on group size and launch timing. No racing other groups, no anxiety about finding camps. Each camp has a fire ring and basic amenities. Your camps are guaranteed and waiting.
- 💩 **Pack out human waste (groover required)** - The Smith mandates portable toilet systems. If you don't own a groover, rent one from outfitters in White Sulphur Springs or Great Falls. Montana FWP provides waste disposal at Eden Bridge takeout. Failing to pack waste results in serious fines and potential ban from future permits.
- 🪨 **Towering limestone cliffs create dramatic scenery** - The Smith flows through white limestone canyon walls that rise 1,000+ feet. The geology is spectacular, with caves, arches, and formations throughout. Take time to explore side canyons and historical sites (there are several old homesteads and ranches visible from the river).
- ❄️ **Early season weather is highly unpredictable** - April-May launches can see snow, rain, wind, sun, and hail all in one day. Temperatures can swing 40-50°F between day and night. Pack serious cold-weather gear including rain layers, warm sleeping bags (20°F rating minimum), and backup dry clothes. Hypothermia is a real risk in cold, wet conditions.
- 🌊 **No whitewater—bring good reading and fishing gear** - With Class I-II maximum, this isn't a whitewater trip. Most of the river is flatwater floating. Bring books, fishing rods, and cameras. The Smith is about the setting, not the adrenaline. Many groups find the mellow pace boring if they're expecting rapids.
- 📵 **No cell service, complete wilderness isolation** - Once you launch at Camp Baker, there's no cell service, no roads, no towns until Eden Bridge. This is true wilderness. Bring satellite communication (inReach or similar) for emergency contact. You're on your own for 59 miles.
- 🚗 **Shuttle logistics are professional and reliable** - Multiple shuttle services operate in White Sulphur Springs. Expect to pay $100-150 per vehicle. Services are professional and experienced. Book shuttles when you receive your permit—peak season shuttles fill up.
