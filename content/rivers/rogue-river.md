# Rogue River

The Rogue River is a Pacific Northwest classic—a perfect 3-4 day wilderness trip through the Wild Rogue Wilderness. With excellent fishing, wildlife viewing, and the option to stay at historic lodges, it's one of the most accessible multi-day trips in the West.

## Overview

The Wild Section of the Rogue flows 40 miles from Grave Creek to Foster Bar through remote canyon country. The river offers continuous Class III water with two significant rapids that demand respect: Rainie Falls and Blossom Bar.

## The Experience

What makes the Rogue special is its versatility. Want a rugged wilderness experience? Camp on the beaches. Prefer a softer adventure? Stay at one of the historic lodges along the way. The fishing for steelhead and salmon is world-class, and wildlife sightings (bears, otters, eagles) are common.

## When to Go

**Spring (May-June):** Higher water, bigger rapids. Fewer people.

**Summer (July-August):** Prime time. Warm water, reliable flows, peak permits.

**Fall (September-October):** Salmon runs, fall colors, cooling temps.

## Permit Strategy

The Rogue permit lottery is competitive but not impossible. Tips:
- Apply for shoulder season dates
- Weekday launches have better odds
- Check for cancellations frequently
- Pre/post season dates are first-come-first-served
