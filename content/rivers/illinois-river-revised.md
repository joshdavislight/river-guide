The Illinois may be the best Class IV-V multi-day raft trip in the West. With extraordinarily clear water (visible 30+ feet deep), mandatory Class V rapids including the legendary Green Wall, and true wilderness character, it's an expert-only destination that delivers an unforgettable experience. From Briggs Creek (or Miami Bar alternative) to Oak Flat, the Illinois flows 31 miles through the remote Kalmiopsis Wilderness in southwestern Oregon.

The Illinois is genuinely special. The water clarity is extraordinary—you can see individual rocks on the bottom 30+ feet down, making it one of the clearest rivers in America. The wilderness is pristine and protected, the whitewater is continuous and challenging from start to finish, and Green Wall—where the river narrows between vertical moss-covered walls—is the mandatory Class V crux that defines the trip. If you're not comfortable with committing Class V whitewater with no portage option, this is absolutely not your river. But for expert boaters, it's arguably the finest technical multi-day in the West.

## When to Go

**February-March:** Best window after winter storms. Flows typically 1,500-3,500 cfs. Cold temps (40-60°F), rain likely. Water is 45-50°F. Prime season for those willing to deal with weather.

**April:** Late season if rain continues. Flows dropping (1,000-2,000 cfs). Slightly warmer temps (50-65°F), less rain. Still cold water (50-55°F).

**May:** Rarely runnable unless it's an exceptionally wet year. Flows usually below 1,000 cfs by early May.

### When NOT to Go

**Low flow (below 1,000 cfs):** The Illinois becomes a brutal rock-scraping slog with difficult portages around shallow rapids. Green Wall becomes technical and dangerous rather than just challenging. Not worth the effort.

**High flow (above 4,000 cfs):** At extreme high water, the continuous Class IV-V becomes relentless and more dangerous. Green Wall at 5,000+ cfs has been described as "terrifying" with enormous holes. Multiple expert groups have had serious incidents at these flows.

**Outside February-April window:** The Illinois is rain-dependent with no dam control. By May, it's usually too low. Before February, it's often too high and dangerous. The window is narrow—plan accordingly.

## Permit Strategy

Self-issue permits at Ray's Food Place in Selma, OR. 100% success rate—if you're qualified and the river is running. No lottery, no reservation, just show up.

**Permit Realities:**
- **Self-certification required:** You must honestly assess whether your group has the skills for mandatory Class V whitewater. There's no gatekeeper checking your resume, but if you're not solid at Class V, people can die on this river.
- **Small group limit (12 people):** This keeps impact low and ensures maneuverability in the tight technical sections. Don't try to exceed this.
- **Ray's Food Place is the permit spot:** In Selma, OR. Fill out paperwork, pay fees, get launch confirmation. Simple process but required.

## Special Considerations

- ⚠️ **Green Wall is mandatory Class V with NO PORTAGE** - Mile 25. This is the defining moment of the trip. The river narrows to 15-20 feet between vertical moss-covered walls, drops through a technical boulder garden with multiple holes, and there is absolutely no portage option. The walls are vertical, the current is swift, and you're committed once you enter. Scout carefully from river left. Multiple lines exist but all require precision. If your group isn't comfortable with this level of commitment, do not attempt the Illinois.
- 🌊 **Submarine Hole at high water** - Mile 20. Above 2,500 cfs, this hole becomes genuinely dangerous with a powerful recirculating current that holds swimmers. Multiple long swims reported. Scout on right, run far left or portage if necessary.
- 🌊 **Continuous Class IV-V from start to finish** - There are no easy miles on the Illinois. From Prelude (mile 5) onwards, it's continuous technical whitewater requiring constant focus and boat control. Exhausting for even experienced boaters. No easy recovery sections.
- ❄️ **Cold water requires drysuits year-round** - Water temps are 45-55°F even in April. Combined with air temps in the 40-60°F range and likely rain, hypothermia risk is extreme. Drysuits are mandatory, not optional. Long swims can be deadly without proper gear.
- 🏔️ **Kalmiopsis Wilderness is extremely remote** - This is one of the most isolated rivers in the lower 48. No roads, no cell service, no easy escape. Helicopter evacuation is the only option for serious injuries and would take hours to coordinate. Your group must be completely self-sufficient.
- ⛈️ **Flash flood history is real** - In December 1964, a massive flash flood on the Illinois killed several boaters. While rare, the narrow canyon and rain-dependent flows create genuine flash flood risk. Watch weather obsessively and have an evacuation plan.
- 💎 **Water clarity is unreal** - The Illinois is fed by springs and has minimal sediment. You can see the bottom at 30+ feet depth. This creates an ethereal, magical quality but also means you can see every rock you're about to hit. The clarity is genuinely stunning.
- 🏕️ **Limited camping options** - Silver Creek (mile 12) and Indigo Creek (mile 18) are the main camps. They're small and can't accommodate large groups. First-come-first-served creates timing pressure. Plan your daily mileage carefully.
- 📊 **Obsessively monitor the gauge** - USGS #14377100 (Illinois near Kerby). Flows change rapidly with rain events. What's runnable on your launch day may be too low or too high two days later. Check gauge multiple times daily before and during your trip.
- 🚗 **Shuttle logistics are complex** - Briggs Creek put-in requires rough dirt roads. Oak Flat takeout is equally remote. Shuttle services know the routes but roads can be impassable in heavy rain. Budget extra time and coordinate carefully.
- 🎣 **Fishing is poor** - Despite the stunning water clarity, the Illinois doesn't have a notable fishery. A few native cutthroat and steelhead, but this isn't a fishing destination.
- ⚠️ **DO NOT attempt without proper skills** - This cannot be overstated. The Illinois is unforgiving. If you haven't successfully run multiple Class V rapids elsewhere, do not attempt this river. People die here when they're overconfident. Be honest with yourself and your group.
