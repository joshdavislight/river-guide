The Main Salmon—"River of No Return"—is Idaho's other world-class wilderness river trip. While it shares the lottery with the Middle Fork, the Main offers bigger water, huge beaches, and a more relaxed pace perfect for families and groups looking for a grand adventure without extreme whitewater. The Main Salmon carves 79 miles through the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness, the largest contiguous wilderness area in the Lower 48.

The river is big volume—up to 50,000 cfs at peak—but the rapids are more forgiving than the Middle Fork's technical pool-drop character. The Main Salmon is the "big beach" trip: massive sand bars perfect for volleyball and frisbee, excellent swimming holes, historic homesteads telling stories of early settlers, and the legendary Barth Hot Springs make this a river that appeals to all ages and skill levels. The fishing is exceptional, with steelhead runs in fall and resident rainbow and cutthroat trout year-round.

## When to Go

**High water (June):** Big, pushy, and exciting at 15,000-30,000+ cfs. Large waves and holes. For experienced boaters comfortable with big volume water.

**Prime season (July-August):** Warm, swimmable, perfect flows (6,000-15,000 cfs) for all skill levels. This is peak family season with warm nights and excellent beach camping.

**Fall (September):** Lower water (3,000-8,000 cfs), steelhead fishing runs begin, fewer people, golden light on canyon walls. Cooler nights require warmer sleeping bags.

### When NOT to Go

**Peak summer crowds (July 15-August 15):** This is the absolute busiest time on the Main Salmon. You'll encounter multiple groups at popular camps, especially Barth Hot Springs which can feel like a river party. If you value solitude, avoid this window.

**Late September after Labor Day:** While fishing can be good, flows often drop below 4,000 cfs making some rapids more technical and rocky. Nights get cold (30s-40s°F).

## Permit Strategy

Shared lottery with the Middle Fork through the [Four Rivers Lottery system](https://www.recreation.gov/permits/234622), but slightly better odds at 3.2%. Tips:
- Apply for both Main and Middle Fork to increase chances
- Early season (late June) and late season (early September) dates have better odds
- The Main is equally spectacular—don't consider it a "consolation prize"
- Weekend launches are most competitive

**Permit Realities:**
- **Shared lottery with Middle Fork means competition**: Many groups apply for both rivers, so you're competing against 20,000+ applicants even though Main Salmon has 252 permits vs Middle Fork's 361.
- **No camp assignments**: Unlike the Middle Fork, the Main Salmon doesn't assign camps during control season. First-come-first-served creates a mild camp race each afternoon.
- **Larger group sizes allowed**: 30-person max vs 24 on Middle Fork. This means bigger commercial trips and potentially more crowding at camps.

## Special Considerations

- 🏕️ **Camp race dynamics** - Unlike the Middle Fork, camps are first-come-first-served. Groups often start jockeying for position by 2-3 PM to secure prime camps. Barth Hot Springs (mile 42.5) is the most competitive.
- 🌊 **Big Mallard at high water** - Above 20,000 cfs, Big Mallard (mile 53) becomes significantly more powerful with a large hole at the bottom. Scout on left. Multiple flips occur here every high-water season.
- 🌡️ **Extreme heat possible** - July-August temps can exceed 105°F. Unlike the Middle Fork's higher elevation, the Main Salmon canyon traps heat. Plan for shade structures and lots of water.
- 🐍 **Rattlesnakes are common** - Especially at lower elevation camps in the first 30 miles. Always check under gear before packing, wear shoes at night, and watch where you put your hands on shore.
- ♨️ **Barth Hot Springs crowds** - While amazing, Barth (mile 42.5) can feel like a river party in peak season with 50+ people. Some groups skip it entirely and enjoy quieter hot springs elsewhere.
- 🎣 **Fishing pressure is real** - Despite excellent fishery, the Main Salmon gets hammered by both private and commercial trips. Best fishing is early morning/evening away from popular camps.
- ❄️ **Cold water risk early season** - June water temps are 45-55°F from snowmelt. Long swims mean hypothermia risk. Dress appropriately with wetsuits or dry suits.
- 🚣 **Final miles flatwater grind** - After Vinegar Creek takeout option (mile 79), many continue to Riggins (mile 99). The final 20 miles include flat water and require rowing. Budget extra time.
- 🏛️ **Historic sites are fragile** - Many homesteads and mining sites along the river. Look but don't touch. Archaeological sites are federally protected.
